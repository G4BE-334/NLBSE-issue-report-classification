1271548795,feature,zoom feature bindable to a joystick button,hey im using the openxr toolkit 113 with reverb g2 in msfs and i have to say that its absolutely fantastic what great work here is my idea i was playing around with the zoom function in the system tab of the toolkit and i actually found it much better for zooming in slightly on the gauges than msfss built in vr cockpit focus or whatever they call it that tries to zoom in vr by moving your head around the cockpit in the direction you are looking obviously its not designed for that as its a menu setting but it made me think the toolkit zoom felt very similar to the dcs vr zoom which just gives you bionic eyes and allows you to zoom in on any gauges without having to move your head closer one of the things it offers as well above the stock msfs focus functionality is the ability to zoom in on stuff outside of the cockpit which can be really useful when looking for airfields or other aircraft etc do you think it would be possible to add a vr zoom joystick binding section to the companion app and then have a vr zoom factor setting within the onscreen toolkit then whenever that joystick binding is held it goes to that zoom setting have the vr zoom factor set up like the current zoom setting so its fully customisable and you can tweak the zoom amount to your liking i think it would be so much easier for glancing own at gauges then the current msfs implementation anyway thanks again for all the work great stuff,NONE

1312761344,feature,would it be possible to create c bindings for rres resource packer system,issue description dealing with exported resources in raylib with c is complicated right now the default way is to copy the resource folder to the output directory but when distributing your gameapp all resources are visible to the customer among many other problems with that way the problem is that loading resources from anywhere else than the disk is very complicated or not possible to my knowledge with raylib c bindings so my only solution would be to compressencrypt the resources when building and then uncompressdecrypt them when the gameapp is started but then the resources are visible again to the user while the gameapp is running raysan already implemented a solution for raylib called rres but it is only available for c right now the resource packer can already be used to pack all the resources into a rres file but there is no way to load that rres file and transform it into raylib types like image font wave etc right now it would be really nice if there would be separate bindings for rres so it can be used with c and it would make raylib with c much more robust ps at least it would be nice to know if you are interested in doing that at all because i don´t need it right now and if you would like to do it i am not going to look for another solution i will also ask notnottech with raylibcslo bindings thanks,NONE

1046864808,feature,extend table allocation options eg table fill resize,currently luau implements two very nice functions for table allocation tablemove tablecreate however luau doesnt offer much support at all for doing our own reallocations of tables such as filling and shrinkinggrowing resizing tablemove and tablecreate both are useful for allocating new data and rearranging existing data however these still limit the prior two use cases with overhead all of these do onetime allocations and perform bulk table changes which is important because it allows for reducing the computational cost of a lot of code in a very general way which especially applies to porting many lower level algorithms or assembly langs into luau but also applies directly to dod code which benefits the most i also got a little carried away with my nerding decided to embrace it and pretty much wrote a whole entire rfc a wack one for this even though its probably really excessive i will probably make a pr since the implementation of the two proposed functions should be quick not sure though pretty much an rfc proposed apis tableresizetable newsize resizes the input array to the input size possibly just a wrapper to luahresizearray with extra sanity and validation tablefilltable indexa indexb value writes value from indexa to indexb into the array resizing it if necessary considered alternatives i considered tablemove for trying to perform resizes but it will only resize a table to allow for all of the elements being moved to fit plus its not particularly elegant this does not allow us to grow tables or shrink them which in comparison would be a bit ambiguous and could be reasonable to address separate to growing it also does not allow us to do bulk writes to existing tables without allocation overhead fill while tablecreate has the desired fill behaviour for tables and could be combined with tablemove to get a decently close alternative it allocates a brand new table which is probably not something we would really like when we might want to be dynamically resizing a table for dod say a big list of debris data we basically double the amount of writes and allocate a new potentially large table justification of incompleteness the implementation of both of these behaviours would make the implementations of both other functions possible to write direct pure luau ports of for example tablecreate tablemove both essentially can be thought of as utilizing both underlying features this might make the two seem redundant but i would argue that because all four of these behaviours exist in other places as their own instructions eg wasm as well as the justification that the reduced overhead is desirable for where any of these functions would be desired to be used because both the tablemove tablecreate functions dont have direct pure lua ports in luau without requiring excessive allocations i would argue that this justifies incompleteness considering that the use cases of the proposed functions are general and used in luau as general utilities which are non specific example in wasm there are two cases i found being used in a lot of lower level algorithms which also apply generally table filling and table shrinkinggrowing resizing for example webassembly has a comparable table system to lua this system actually has two instructions that luau has tablemove is essentially a 11 implementation of wasms tablecopy instruction and tablecreate is essentially a 11 implementation of wasms tableinit instruction wasm offers both the ability to fill and the ability to limitedly resize tables,NONE

1306008081,feature,syntaxprovider in incremental source generators caches a lot of symbols for large solutions,we have a large solution with many projects many of which use source generators at the moment we use four nonincremental generators we use these very extensively to generate a lot of source files because we have performance problems with our current generators we wanted to change them to incremental generators because they are made for such large solutions during this conversion we noticed a problem all generators use syntaxproviders these have a predicate and a transform if i understood it correctly the result of the predicate is cached because the transform step must be run again but the predicate only if something has actually changed in the syntax tree this is possible because the driver knows which nodes have changed and can therefore safely skip the predicate however the transform may have changed even if it has not since it works on the semantic model now the thing is that many of our source generators hit a lot of symbols by this i mean that for example one of our source generators hits almost every class definition of our whole solution in the predicate step where we are mainly interested in the name of the class and generates things based on that another one hits almost every property of almost every class this in combination with our solution size leads to a lot of symbols being cached from the first predicate you can see this in the ram usage which is very high 610 gb range in the process after porting 3 of 4 source generators to their incremental version now however the fact is that we actually dont need the semantic model for our generators at all our existing nonincremental source generators also only use the syntactic model therefore the question if there would be a possibility to get access to the syntactic model only thereby if i have understood it correctly no caching of the expensive symbols would be necessary any more the necessary information from the syntactic model would be also only very small in the one example only the class name why a fast extraction is no problem only the caching of the symbols from the predicate step causes problems a further advantage would be that a change of a file can have only a very limited effect on the output since there is no access to the semantic model,NONE

579963517,feature,allow different scorers during validation inference,rocket feature request during inference one might like to score with different metrics bleu rouge precisionrecall gleu define a common scorer interface and allow implementing different scorers eg registerevalscorer motivation on some datasets i need to score my translation results with rouge and precisionrecall as this is the common practice pitch 1 define an registerevalscorer decorator and a protocol that scorers need to follow 11 a scorerefs hypos method that computes a summable score for a batch and returns that as a dictionary which will be included in loggingoutputs 12 a criterion that reduces the logging outputs to a single score for the whole validation set and logs this as a scalar or derived scalar to metrics 2 in translation 21 remove the bleu specific arguments from translation 22 leave and rename inference specific arguments in translation eg evalscorerremovebpe 23 generation should only be triggered when an evaluation scorer is set 24 the references and hypos the output of the generator are then passed to a scorer or multiple scorers and let the scorer handle the logging of the metrics im not sure if this could be integrated in fairseqgenerate but it seems possible to me alternatives an alternative would be to generate with fairseqgenerate parse the output and score it yourself this is hard to do during validation additional context i implemented this for myself using the following code on translation this is just a modified version of evalbleu it passes the hypos and references to an evalscorer which implements a scorehypos refs method and returns the scores as a dictionary which can be included in loggingoutputs the task then calls criterion on that scorer which should process the loggingoutputs and log scalars to metrics note that this only supports one scorer at a time while it would be possible to have multiple scorers process the translations however i dont know

1084140303,feature,logistic normal distribution feature request,thank you for all the tremendous work here as compositionaldata guru john aitchison has noted the dirichlet distribution tends to be useful in theory but not very often in practice due to its unrealistic assumption that multiple events which together form a simplex somehow have no correlation whatsoever with one another even when transformed off the sumto1 constraints one solution to this problem is the logistic normal distribution whereby the model becomes a multivariate normal regression with the intercepts as logits summing to 1 under a simplex and the various components then gain a correlation matrix in addition to making compositional data analysis much more meaningful it can offer a workaround for multinomial models that prefer to recognize correlation among outcomes but wish to avoid the dreaded multinomial probit as long as the modeler is willing to recast the various counts as compositions of a whole with weights reflecting the number of trials for each row the logistic normal distribution seems to come up most often in connection with latent dirichlet analysis and especially correlated topic modeling but it has independent and more straightforward usefulness in the compositional data context the logistic normals little brother the logitnormal can be a more flexible alternative to the beta distribution as it is the mvbind framework seems fully able to handle the multivariate normal nature of the outcomes even with weights thus it seems like it would only require a few lines of additional stan code to add this capability to brmss existing multivariate model structure because we are talking about adding transformed parameters not a whole new density function having said that i am struggling a bit at how that code would end up looking much less how it would be coded most efficiently so while recognizing time is limited and there are no doubt plenty of requests for various distributions families to be supported i think this one would be a very worthy addition,NONE

1170757442,feature,math formulas,i am using pubpub to write a book courselecture notes on mathematical logic i am loving pubpub but the text i write contains on average one or two math formulas per sentence and the wysiwyg editor of pubpub drives me crazy in this respect to make this more precise here is what i have to do to insert a formula even a simple x i move my mousecursor to the formula button and click on it a default formula is inserted into the text i click on the standard formula a popup window opens displaying the default formula i click on the popup window to gain focus i erase the default formula i click on the update button this is so laborious that i now do the following as a work around i type the entire text in codimd which is a mark down editor with math support and regularly remove the entire content from pubpub and import the md file from codimd here is what would make my work easier and is probably easy to implement a keyboard shortcut that opens a popup window for directly editing math for instance ctrlm for an inline formula und ctrlshiftm for a displayed formula the popup window is empty so no default formula the focus is directly in the edit area of the popup area a keyboard shortcut for saving updating the formula the point here is that this can all be done using the keyboard no mouse interaction necessary only a few additional key strokes for entrering a math formula in fact this would be as fast and convenient as surrounding math formulas by or as is usual in other contexts maybe this is the wrong place to discuss this issue i would be very grateful for any advise where to post it instead,NONE

1344861031,feature,allow setting of git config settings within action container,suggestion i have a rather unusual situation and wanted to see if there is a more graceful way to handle this than what ive already done before submitting a pr the setup is this i have a terraform module repository that itself contains a git submodule and the submodule is referenced with an ssh style url eg the module reference itself in the tf file uses an https style git url eg git both of these are private repositories using the existing env var i can get the initial clone of the module to work however when it tries to check out the submodule because gogetter the library used by terraform always checks out submodules it fails because it still tries to use ssh to clone it and theres no available ssh key to use while ill could probably try and pr an enhancement to that library to allow disabling of that always check out submodules functionality and subsequently terraform to use the updated library thats going to take a bit of time in the meantime the only way ive gotten this to work is by setting the global git configuration to use an insteadof directive that replaces gitgithub urls with ones you can see how i did this with a new input here and a change to the shared actionssh scripts setup function here since this is all in a container i dont think it would affect anything beyond the run itself ie its not going to muck with the global git config on the runner is there a better way to do this if not happy to submit a pr from my fork with this new functionality thanks,NONE

635521839,feature,product flavor for using mock exposure notification api,in the code you mention a plan to add a product flavor that should use a mock exposure notification api is this something that could be done as a contribution looking at it seems like one option could be to inject a differentmock implementation that returns some dummy values this at least would allow launching the app without any api support on the device did you have more elaborate plans eg controlling the mocked api via an activity or test app would be interested in contributing this if possible internal tracking id exposureapp1967,NONE
372885598,feature,create rules in a specific order so that hasuserlabels works as a filter condition,a few of my rules rely on ordering which i understand it not guaranteed however it seems to work the specific requirement is that they test for the presence or absence or labels from other rules this allows me to avoid giant nested structures i can do this with hasuserlabels or hasnouserlabels is there any potential for supporting this as a condition,NONE
1222723543,feature,add support for disabled mods,currently im using ferium witn polymc and when im debugging mods i will often disable mods via polymc when a mod is disabled it will add disabled at the end of the mod name but when i do ferium upgrade it will automatically enable the mod again i want ferium to not touch disabled mods,NONE

1139281123,feature,allow resize of window,allow resizing the client window in terms of usability it would be much better faster more transparent to allow users resize the window for having the chance to see full file names of conflicting files currently file names are truncated at the end and therefore often not identifiable by users further note truncating file names at the end is not helpful when trying to distinguish files in folders with long paths a better approach would be to remove parts of the filename from the middle of the file as used by macos in the finder,NONE

1165501645,feature,feat enumerate buffer tabs in tabline,before creating a new request search existing issues and prs and ensure it hasnt been already requested requested feature similar to other buffer line extensions it would be useful to have custom numbering for buffers in the buffer line instead of using the internal buffer number of nvim motivation the buffer number increments for the life time of a vim session this could lead to large numbers if the session is long lived this makes it cumbersome to select the desired buffer and only really saves an ls for the user it also makes it hard to jump to the first buffer in the buffer line as you need to know the buffer number if buffer tabs where numbered sequentially the first tab would be 1 always i understand that this request is more complex than it appears since in order to make use of these sequential numbers custom mappings will need to be provided by the plugin to select a specific buffer which will take care of the translation between sequential number and internal buffer number but it would greatly improve the usability,NONE

628151092,feature,zstd add nogoroutine option to encoding,to start i appreciate that the concurrency allows for greater speed its great backstory i have a project that manages different types of encoding options for thousands of configs as a rule when compressing data for an individual config we only want to compress serially we have thousands of other concurrent compressors and we do not want one utilizing more cpu than necessary our current use of the zstd encoder is to create one per config and use the option this works for the most part but we now have to be careful about properly closing the zstd compressor in the face of write errors for other compressors we can just drop the writer and have it be garbage collected with no dangling resources for the zstd compressor unless things are closed properly goroutines leak an alternative option for me would be to use a global zstd encoder with the default encoder concurrency and just never close it im not much of a fan of this approach though since with poor scheduling some goroutines could sit in the compressing zstd goroutines for longer than they need to and block other configs that need to be zstd compressing its likely not a large risk but its one im concerned about feature request i think itd be both convenient and faster if there was an option to not spawn goroutines for encoding convenient in that when i am done with the compressor i can just drop it this would also make the zstd encoder an option to use in syncpools where it is not an option today faster in that there will not be goroutine synchronization and message passing overhead especially so since i know im always encoding serially per encoder,NONE

1077682020,feature,add typescript support,issue to be solved add support for typescript so that autocomplete and other developer tooling works optional suggest a solution solution 1 rewrite in typescript pretty self explanatory would probably take weeks because typescript usually messes you up at edge cases this would automatically generate type definitions when building to javascript solution 2 add typescript declaration file create dts file this would have to be maintained separately if the code base stays in plain javascript separately means here that you might forget to update the dts file and functions dont conform to it comparison solution 1 rewrite is certainly more work than solution 2 type declarations typescript is widely used right now and many developers would consider it easier to contribute to the codebase after solution 1 if it was fully written in typescript which may or may not be objectively true optional context its not blocking anything but it makes development a little harder because you always have to check out the docs and depending on the strictness of your config typescript constantly yells at you for missing types,NONE

569413420,feature,api nomenclature improvements,hi while working through porting mirror project to mlapi i noticed mlapi is a bit too verbose and we can improve the api by making more concise and adding a couple of apis i understand that mapi does not use weaver therefore its more verbose but good naming can help us a lot throughout the development here is the reason behind for the current api change requests i think api doesnt always have to be grammatically correct as long as its consistent and the meaning is clear grammatically correct naming can often be a bit too long and it often makes the editing difficult as a function with many arguments can make the text wrap around to the next line having said that here are my proposals regarding invoke apis invokerpc means just calling rpc and the meaning will not change by just call it without invoke in front of it oneveryone can be shortened by all oneveryoneexcept can be shortened by just except as it will always be called on everyone and that there is no conflict so the new proposed changes are the following rpcclientall rpcclientexcept invokeclientrpc rpcclient invokeserverrpc rpcserver regarding passthrough rpc right now you have to look at clientrpc to know if its passthrough call or not its a bit hard to remember by just looking at the function all also clientrpc can either be called from clientpassthrough and server so having the passthrough attribute in the spec is semantically wrong if you want to call it from the server therefore i request to add the following new apis to the passthrough rpc version we just change rpc to rptc short for rptcclientall rptcclientexcept lastly while going to the code the word network sometimes called networked networking or network for no clear reasons i guess networedbehaviour is more grammatically correct but the word network is more common in programming mixing the words makes it a bit hard to remember i propose to consolidate networking networked to just network for example networkedbehaviour networkbehaviour netwokingmanager networkmanager thanks,NONE

1373432579,feature,feature add the license file to the binary targz archives in releases,hi first of all thanks for your awesome with gitmux is your feature request related to a problem please describe not necessarily a problem but it would better suit the best practice in terms of licensing as it implies to include the license file with your project which is not the case when installing gitmux via binary release as you only get the binary and not the license in the targz archive also i maintain the gitmuxbin aur package and this request would make the maintenance easier on my side indeed gitmux being protected by the mit license i have to include the license file in addition to the binary during the installation process see as the license file is not included in the binary targz archive itself i have to get it directly from the github repo while grabbing the license file directly from the github repo is not an issue from a technical stand point the archlinux packaging guidelines and bestpractices imply to check the integrity of every downloaded resources through their hashes before the installation process for obvious security reason according to that the installation process of the gitmuxbin aur package depends on the integrity of a file that is subject to change without necessarily leading to a new release in other words a change of the license file on the github repo can make the build fail even tho theres no new release nor changes to the binary until i update the hash of the license file accordingly in the pkgbuild and publish the update if the file was provided in the binary targz archive directly i would not have to rely on its hash as verifying the integrity of the archives itself would be enough preventing the possibility of a failed build because of a change in the license file on the github repo the targz archives would then be enough to deliver both the binary and the license file describe the solution youd like adding the license file into the different binary targz archives in releases describe alternatives youve considered while not being as clean as the solution described above an alternative would be to add the license file directly to the releases assets it will make the maintenance on my side a little bit easier as grabbing the license file from the release guarantee that it will not change thus nor its hash until the next release but thats still an additional file to download and check during the install process also this alternative will not change the fact that the mit custom license will not be provided to people that install gitmux via binary release additional context im aware that the license file shouldnt be modified too frequently and thus the above described case might be pretty rare on the other hand i assume this change is fairly easy to do and would improve the binary targz archives structure and the maintenance of the gitmuxbin aur package hence my suggestion thanks for your awesome work btw,NONE

1289289921,feature,fr enable 4 tune profiles either by default or as a branch option,is your feature request related to a problem please describe summary would be changing the provided 3 tune profiles to 4 tune profiles and all variables subsumed into that and deconflicting changes with migrating tpa values to the tuneprofile blocks very minor edge case problem but having a fourth tune profile makes it possible to further idiotproof multivoltage racing setups that can actually fly with a very wide range of input voltages and take advantage of the cell count autoprofile switching facility the primary manifestation of this problem is that when using cell count autoprofile to accommodate different cell count batteries many of these configurations end up with a gap where the profile does not change and operates off the previously selected profile which in the case of freedomspectexasspec tune profiles that use high gains when 3s batteries are selected can result in severe flyaway conditions and motor burning when a higher voltage battery is plugged in not resulting in a new tune profile being selected this is an indirect answer to a user error but this is a user error i have made made times with mixed results i do realize i am among the few users actually bothering with multivoltage tunes but particularly for nonadvanced racers newer pilots budgetconstrained race pilots or expanding the utility of certain spec racing configurations this would be a nice benefit describe the solution youd like define pidprofilecount 3 define pidprofilecount 4 in and also in the unit test here configurator integration would also be required if this becomes a default behavior although making this an edge case parallel compiled branch and relying extensively on presets could reduce the need for this nearterm i dont know enough to fully grasp what that change would entail describe alternatives youve considered the limitations on this are likely to be total memory space allocation adding another set of tune profile parameters stored on flash to use and that would currently only benefit a small subset of users with a marginal improvement in utility since this is really to combat one specific type of user error induced problem when using a very specific type of multivoltage preset and is only ever applicable with high performance craft in a kv range that allows for four different cell counts to actually be useful compiling and using a separate branch would work and integrating a separate configurator and preset system can be achieved but the intent of this overall package is to enable more pilots to take advantage of a more fully idiotproofed multivoltage system that can safely fly well no matter what battery is plugged in especially with applying motor output limits to specific overvoltage configurations other information if this makes sense to push to back burner especially if flash space constraints are significant that is fine as stated above this is a very unique edge cases that requires a combination of relatively advanced multivoltage tunes and egregious user error to produce erroneous functionality and there is a definite flash space cost to implement,NONE

480619934,feature,compiling different parts of angular application in specific zones,oh hi there to expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one existing issues often contain information about workarounds resolution or progress updates rocket feature request relevant package this feature request is probably for angularcompiler angularcore description i am not sure that it is must have feature of angular framework but probably some of you can show the way how i can achieve what i need without changing the code of angular probably it would be nice for some cases to have some mechanism to compile component and its child components in specific zones chilren of angular zone for example we have 2 business parts in out application for example we have shop part and settings part in our app i think it would be nice to compile components in shop part in some child zone of angular zone like shop settings part would be compiled in settings zone also it would be nice to allow create hierarchy of zones like shopcart or shopsales or settingsprofile settingssubscription settingscards etc also you can have shared reusable component which is used in settings and in shop modules it would be compiled in settingslist and shoplist zones what are profits easily debug how your application works for example you have shared service with business logic or logger service and you can understand context in methods of such services track contexts of api requests for example in our app we have tons of requests and we can implement some monitoring on server side we use such feature in angularjs part of our application describe the solution youd like if you have a solution in mind please describe it example component selector appshopcontainer template zone shop export class shopcart component selector appshopcart template zone cart export class shopcart ngafterviewinit fetchcart this would be in zone shopcart component selector appshopgoods template export class shopgoods ngafterviewinit fetchgoods this would be in zone shop since we dont have zone property in decorator component selector appsettingscontainer template zone settings export class shopgoods ngafterviewinit fetchsomething this would be in zone settings component selector appprofiledata template zone profiledata export class shopgoods ngafterviewinit fetchprofile this would be in zone settingsprofiledata or shopprofiledata it depends on place where component is rendered in shop module or in settings module all of these zones are children of angular zone so they would not affect change detection rendering and others i think it could be made by improvement of componentdirective decorators zone properties should be added there this properties should somehow be stored in views which are created when application compiles for example in viewzone property and final point that ngfactories of viewscomponents if i remember correctly it is about should be called in viewzone zone if zone was not passed to componentdirective decorator then zone from parent view would be in created view if anybody will use something like method in such zones he will get same result as now since all of created zones are children of angular zone describe alternatives youve considered have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds our team tried some ways i will describe one of them which was the closest we tried to create our own decorator like component which will call constructor and patch methods of the component patched methods are same methods but with zonerun wrapper such decorator was able to accept zonename property this way does not work since we got exception on aot build any way this way is not what we need there if i remember correctly there was not any problem with calling cdrdetectchanges manually zones were correct in child components but if component was created after calling appreftick then zone was not correct angular zone it happened because some other part of application triggered tick and changedetection from root trying to run appreftick in some specific zone is not correct since change detection in whole application would be performed in some specific zone seems to me correct way to solve the problem is running ngfactories of components in needed zones,NONE

1084536324,feature,allow cache file glob customization,hello netlify is the honeybee s mankneeling s thanks for maintaining it this issue relates to a chronic problem i encounter maintaining nodejs builds using npm or yarn for example an app might specify npm run build as its build command for the netlify runner the problem occurs when i use patchpackage to maintain patches against my nodemodules dependencies if you are unaware patchpackage is a node module which when run against a package name creates diff files in patchespatch that reflect the project maintainers changes to her dependencies an example workflow project maintainer runs npm install slidem project maintainer manually edits files in nodemodulesslidemjs project maintainer runs npx patchpackage slidem patchpackage writes which is a git diff between the canonical slidem128 and maintainers changes project maintainer adds postinstall patchpackage to the projects root packagejson whenever postinstall runs it applies the patch created earlier the problem with this workflow is that the nodemodules are cached even if the patch file changes this typically has one of two effects 1 patchpackage fails with non0 exit code failing the build 2 the build succeeds but the changes in the patch file are not implemented in the final build potentially breaking the deployed app which contains project code that expects the patch tohavebeen applied i described this problem in a support forum thread where fool kindly offered some suggestions i believe that in the second case i listed his apicall approach will still fail so the best solution is one in which the user can optionally specify additional files to consider when deciding whetherornot to bust the cache ie the netlify user should be allowed to specify that changes in patchespatch should invalidate the cache just as changes in packagelockjson do would you be interested in reviewing a pr to that effect see also 281 113,NONE

strstringlength or at least the sql compiler and or what ever optimizer is in charge does not know about it why would it need a bulk stringlength operation the first query finishes in 76ms comment 14526 date 20100722 200831 0200 from drstmane you tell me how often sql length resp mal strstringlength needs to be called either of your depends on you actual data size value distribution selection and join selectivity etc and i dont know that basically the answer to this question should answer your question comment 14527 date 20100722 201533 0200 from skinkie in reply to comment 9 you tell me how often sql length resp mal strstringlength needs to be called either of your depends on you actual data size value distribution selection and join selectivity etc and i dont know that basically the answer to this question should answer your question the amount of records match the resultset of the first operation if the length length is preferred over the equijoin while the number of values of combined equijoins is lower and no sql function is used how is it possible that the first query that puts the same clause in the select part takes 76ms and the second query that filters on the where clause of the first query plus the second query breaks comment 14528 date 20100722 202758 0200 from drstmane from the algebra plan and mal explain plans you provided i read that for the first query length is called twice for each result tuple while for the second query length is called twice for each result tuple plus once for each tuple in table uitspraken plus once for each tuple in table uitsprakennew the difference is one reasons for exection time differences between the two queries what ever they might be comment 14529 date 20100722 203513 0200 from skinkie in reply to comment 11 the difference is one reasons for exection time differences between the two queries what ever they might be so pragmatically is my assumption that the 2 lengthfunctions should exclusively be called for the rows that are selected by the id id correct if that doesnt hold i probably am missing a fundamental thing comment 14530 date 20100722 214312 0200 from drstmane your assumption is reasonable in theory the details are much more complicated in practice the problem is usually referred to as database query optimization and has been proven to be nphard even in theory comment 14531 date 20100722 215849 0200 from drstmane by the way i would appreciate if you would at some point in time not mind sharing with us how long the second query actually runs only then we could properly assess the severity of the problem with all respect a statement like doesnt finish fast enough does not help us much further with the first query finishing in 76 ms killing the second query after 76 ms is everything but an indication of poor performance to me also could you please explain a bit more clearly than but now the database does crash in which case the assertion occurs when staring the server when running the which query when running the which query after restarting the server please not also that bug 2607 mentions a hanging server in relation with a similar assertion as reported here comment 14532 date 20100722 232047 0200 from skinkie in reply to comment 14 by the way i would appreciate if you would at some point in time not mind sharing with us how long the second query actually runs i have no clue how long i actually takes i actually thought waiting 5 minutes was a proper indication to file a bug if i can gather the same information in 76ms but the actual point is now that when i remove the constraints i actually end up in the same assertion that i didnt see before and this was about 3 minutes so i wonder now if i should reload the secondary table without the primary keyunique in the first place to get the same result only then we could properly assess the severity of the problem with all respect a statement like doesnt finish fast enough does not help us much further with all respect if the following query does finish in 77ms i truly feel that i showed by both plans enough information was provided to unfold an issue in the plan generation plan select x

that bug 2607 mentions a hanging server in relation with a similar assertion as reported here server does not hang comment 14537 date 20100726 182026 0200 from drstmane in a different context i just ran a query that perform 100 m 100000000 legth resp strstringlength call in about 100 second ie one per microsecond using on optimized build of the jun2010sp1 release on a 24 gb core2quad hence i doubt that the maliterated as opposed to bulk strstringlength is a significant performance problem i suspect now more than already indicated before that the second query reported here just happens to trigger a situation that leads to the assertion andor hanging server while processing that query as reported in bug 2607 see details there comment 14538 date 20100726 182720 0200 from skinkie in reply to comment 16 i suspect now more than already indicated before that the second query reported here just happens to trigger a situation that leads to the assertion andor hanging server while processing that query as reported in bug 2607 see details there is the actual hang to pinpoint sowhere in the mal plan or is it not that fixed the hang might eat cpu time ok can live with that but wasnt the idea of optimizers to always execute the same kind of query hence my rewrite of the query should result in the same failing query comment 14547 date 20100727 201834 0200 from mlkersten the multiplex version of the sql stringlength operator was missing it has been added to the kernel comment 14567 date 20100730 165323 0200 from skinkie in reply to comment 18 the multiplex version of the sql stringlength operator was missing it has been added to the kernel i would like to confirm that this indeed has fixed the issue making it possible to execute the query sqlselect uitsprakenid from uitspraken uitsprakennew where uitsprakenid uitsprakennewid and id 390815 390904 385703 390984 386513 390801 390658 373523 8 tuples 32122s hot 10s but having already elaborated in the initial issue it seems the wrong choice is made because the following query results within 100ms sqlselect x from select uitsprakenid as x as y from uitspraken uitsprakennew where uitsprakenid uitsprakennewid as z where zy false x 390815 390904 385703 390984 386513 390801 390658 373523 8 tuples 64491ms comment 14595 date 20100802 114721 0200 from drstmane to clarify the improvement of bulk over iterated length strstringlength ie of is a factor ie for my 100000000 tuple test execution time went down from 100 secs to 20 secs note also that fixed a deadlock that i still suspect to be the reason why the second query did imho was indeed never tested let alone confirmed hang finally the choice how to translate and implement singlecolumn vs multicolumns joins in monetdb is inherent in the monetdb architecture

1160474992,feature,issue need assistance getting thelounge to look in an unexpected field for ldap password,feature description hello i have asked my question in the support channel and was sent here i dont know whether you would consider this a support request or a feature request if what i am doing is not supported i have been reviewing what seems to be obsolete or very old code for thelounge version 2 or 3x something for a days i am running 430 and it turns out none of what i read even closely resembles how any of this works anymore we have ldap in place for anope already but our passwords are cleartext and i can all but guarantee are in a place thelounge probably is not looking for them they are in the description field rather than userpassword or some such we decided to use the generic top account objectclass a long time ago because we could not get support from anope or anyone else at that time can anyone provide feedback on what module to edit to have private mode query description for the password i am reviewing something called ldapjs from several versions ago for better or worse we just upgraded thelounge about two weeks ago and that does not exist anywhere on my system and none of this even closely resembles the old behavior i am familiar with the mapping is in the base dn ldapourchatroomorg objectclass account so i assume scope is either one or base rather than sub i attempted to use the exact same filter as anope or variations on the default one based on my review of this older ldapjs it could be a filter problem but is most likely the fact that at least as of that version thelounge apparently returned the same error regardless of whether the user really doesnt exist or whether the user existed and the password was wrong and some changes were made along the way because of an old bug where thelounge let people log in with a valid ldap user and blank password i believe what i am stumbling into is the result of fixes made for that behavior the current behavior of the current modules is somewhat less better discussed or documented i have been at this for about 12 hours i believe i will not be successful no matter what filter i use until i modify thelounge to use description as the password field advice on a filter string is welcome and maybe even desperately needed but my interpretation is that i will get the error below whether the user really doesnt exist or the filter is wrong or whether i mapped the user successfully but thelounge decided theres no password or its trying to query a password field that does not exist in the account objectclass essentially i just want people registered with nickserv to be able to log in the methods i have available are sasl and ldap thelounge appears to only support ldap or local manually created authentication entries in private mode if i have this correct impact is low i am fighting with this on a clone of our system in an oracle virtualbox thank you very much in advance if anyone can explain how to modify where passwords are validated userid ircnickname host email address description cleartextpassword heres an example of a user dn objectclass top objectclass account uid amy host amyourchatroomorg description myinsecurepassword account entryuuid creatorsname createtimestamp 20220305224114z entrycsn modifiersname modifytimestamp 20220305224114z 20220305 233612 info there are currently no users create one with thelounge add 20220305 233615 warn ldap search did not find anything for amy 0 20220305 233615 warn authentication for non existing user attempted from 1234,NONE

974196152,feature,feature request mouse acceleration per key,feature request type core functionality addon hardware support eg audio rgb oled screen etc alteration of existing features x new behavior description i only recently started to use mouse mode on my keyboard but i think the current behavior of the mouse acceleration doesn’t really work well for me the cursor is accelerated as long as any mouse movement key is pressed this is physically counterintuitive—the acceleration is discontinuous when changing the direction— but i also think this is impractical in many cases most of the time when i need to move the cursor over a long distance i only need to move it over a long distance on one axis and only a shortshorter distance on the other axis so let’s say i start going to the right the cursor gets accelerated and then i want to move up a little but the speed in the upwards direction is too high because of the acceleration when the cursor moves very fast i often find myself overshooting the target and having to correct if i press the opposite direction before releasing the previous key the cursor moves with the same speed in the opposite direction and hence i will overshoot in the opposite direction to fix these problems i suggest to track the speed and acceleration of each directional movement key separately so horizontal and vertical movement speeds would not influence each other and going in the opposite direction would reset the current speed the only downside i can imagine without having tried it in action is that it would become difficult to go in a straight diagonal of 45 degrees but when would you ever require this implementing this suggestion would require some breaking changes in quantummousekeyc maybe i’m just using the mouse movement wrong i don’t know if you don’t experience these problems i’d be curious to learn what you do differently,NONE

1323323215,feature,forward allow modification of query flags eg always set rd,what would you like to be added allow modification of dns query flags within the forward plugin especially i would like to set the rd recursion desired flag so that an upstream dns server performs internal recursive resolution even the client or another recursive resolver didnt request recursive resolution why is this needed im currently building a rewriteforward setup towards the internal aws ec2 and gcp vm dns servers to allow resolution of ec2 or gcp vm instance names within an existing dns infrastructure overview and query path client queries through existing onprem dns infrastructure onprem dns recursive resolver arbitrary recursive dns resolver eg unboundbind through ns records for awseuwest1examplecom it knows which authority nameserver or in this case onprem dns forwarder servers should be queried onprem dns forwarder coredns acts as authority for awseuwest1examplecom and forwards the query to another coredns server in the aws vpc this may sound overkill but allows to use dns over tls caching etc on the onprem dns forwarder coredns server in aws vpc rewrites query from to and forwards query to aws ec2 dns server 169254169253 aws ec2 dns server 169254169253 resolves and generate response thanks to corednss rewrite and forward plugins this already works great for gcp but often fails with aws ec2 dns server after multiple hours debugging and reading wireshark captures i identified the problem the onprem dns recursive resolver queries without the rd flag recursion desired as it would perform the recursive resolution all coredns instances onprem and in aws correctly forward the query without the rd flag to the aws ec2 dns resolver what i learned is that the aws ec2 dns server 169254169253 is also a recursive dns server if it has no cache entry for it must perform a recursive dns resolution without the rd flag the aws ec2 dns server just provides a list of root servers and assumes the client will perform the required recursive resolution if a client explicitly queries the onprem dns forwarder with the rd flag the rd flag is transported though the forward chain and the aws ec2 dns server provides the correct answer this also updates its internal cache and subsequent queries from the onprem dns recursive resolver without the rd flag also receive a valid response until the cache expired the same setup already works for gcp as the gcp dns service doesnt care about the rd flag and acts like an authority nameserver eventually i would like to instruct the forward plugin to set the rd flag so that the aws ec2 dns server always perform internal recursive resolution thoughts and opinions about the idea would be highly appreciated my go skills are limited but i could try to provide an initial pull request with such an enhancement,NONE

679822881,feature,control plane authentication,technically this is not a bug but rather a feature request but seeing that there are other issues labeled enhancement i suppose that its still right place to write about it issue description the problem is that it looks like there is no way to authenticate websocket control connections apart from firewall and reverse proxybased ones at least i found none in configs and docs even with reverse proxy ways eg i can configure nginx to check auth there is a problem that kurento always binds to 0000 and it seems that there is no corresponding config option to make it bind to localhost so anyone can connect to server instance and use it for their own needs consuming server resources i see configuration option for websocket path so it can be used assuming kurento will reject incorrect paths but i think that usage of this option is rather a dirty hack than authentication solution eg passing tokens as urls is generally bad idea and i dont think that it was originally intended as authentication feature proposed solution something as simple as shared secret or mutual tls client certs would be sufficient and should be rather easy to implement,NONE

1350063919,feature,avoid build order for subassembly,please verify that this feature request has not been suggested before x i checked and didnt find similar feature request problem statement thanks a lot for creating this amazing software i have maybe more of a question than a feature request when designing a pca board in kicad i can import most items for the complete board to inventree but some items like the pcb itself heat sinks screws nuts etc will not come from kicad and has to be added for a complete bom to simplify the work with new revisions i have tried to find a way to reuse the bom for the added items upload a new file with the kicad changes and merge the two together but i do not really find a good way to achieve this suggested solution i guess the part template is not really designed for this use case do you have any other suggestion how to use already existing features to achieve what im looking for if not would a template part that can be marked as virtual make sense or would that violate the idea with template parts describe alternatives youve considered my first attempt was just to duplicate the pca part and remove all parts that will come from kicad before uploading the new revision but its manual work and rather easy to remove one item to much or to little for larger boms what i then tried is to create a subassembly as a template part and there i import the kicad components then i create a top level part for the pca or rather a child as it is described in the template documentation where the bom consists of the sub assembly part plus the extra material my thought for a new revision was then to create a new subassembly part where i import the updated kicad bom duplicate the top level pca part and in the bom just change the part code for the subassembly to the new revision minimum of manual editing i have used this model for a few examples and it all works fine but what i cannot find a solution to is that i have to create a fake build order also for the sub assembly i have played around with the inherited tagging of bom line items but i do not really see any impact the subassembly bom itself can so nicely be expanded from the top level bom pricing seems to work also but there is always a need for this extra build order i have even tried to set the subassembly as virtual as that level shouldwill never exist as a real part does not work either but as i have understood the virtual part its intended for another use case examples of other systems no response do you want to develop this i want to develop this,NONE

1117631142,feature,missing fspromises apis dup dup2 fdopen,what is the problem this feature will solve the fs module exposes most of the oslevel file operations one would expect but a few are missing and the missing operations that i particularly need today are dup and dup2 in addition fspromises does not currently offer a way to wrap a filehandle around an oslevel file descriptor i suggest that the name for this operation should be fdopen matching cposix the use case i have in mind today for all three of these functions is for programs that in the unix tradition generate data and write it to processstdout simply calling processstdoutwrite or has two problems today first this can be extremely inefficient because processstdout does no buffering second several methods of the global console object write to processstdout so thirdparty libraries that call eg consoleinfo perhaps only rarely can corrupt your output and there doesnt appear to be any official way to reconfigure the console object to not do that if fs had dup dup2 and fdopen i could work around these problems with a function like import as fs from fspromises import process from process async function options const stdoutcopy await fsdupprocessstdoutfd await processstdoutfd return fsfdopenstdoutcopy this rearranges things at the level of file descriptors such that output to processstdout including via the console is now sent to processstderr and then returns a normal in particular buffering writestream that sends data to the original processstdout the data generator can be piped to this stream and it can be closed without causing problems for unrelated code that assumes processstdout is always open other use cases for fspromisesfdopen are common any time a nodejs program receives an oslevel file descriptor from external code the first thing it probably wants to do with it is wrap it in a filehandle just off the top of my head existing apis that might hand a nodejs program a bare file descriptor include systemds sdlistenfds mechanism server processes are started with extra fds open beyond stdinouterr and are expected to retrieve these fds and use them as listening sockets the wayland clipboard protocol involves transferring a file descriptor from one client to another via a scmrights special socket message use cases for dup and dup2 are more unusual but do exist particularly in lowlevel code what is the feature you are proposing to solve the problem add the following functions to the fspromises module typescript notation used to document function arguments and return types duplicate an oslevel file descriptor by default the new fd is marked closeonexec supply closeonexec false as options to have it not be closeonexec implementation note posix dup2 primitive fcntlfd fdupfdcloexec may also be useful export async function dupfd number options closeonexec boolean number duplicate oslevel file descriptor oldfd assign the duplicate file descriptor number newfd replacing any existing fd with that number by default the new fd is not marked closeonexec because a frequent reason to want a specific number for the duplicate is because youre going to transfer it to an execed program supply closeonexec true to have the new fd be closeonexec implementation note posix dup22 primitive linuxs dup3 extension may also be useful export async function dup2oldfd number newfd number options closeonexec boolean void create a filehandle object that wraps an existing oslevel file descriptor export function fdopenfd number filehandle a filehandledup method returning another filehandle not a bare fd would also be appropriate for completeness async function options return fdopenawait dupthisfd options what alternatives have you considered the fscreatereadstream and fscreatewritestream functions in the old fs module offer a fd option this makes them sufficient for many situations where fspromisesfdopen would be useful however they involve using the old fs module rather than fspromises and filehandle objects have many other handy features that people might want my specific use case for dup and dup2 could be addressed directly in the standard library essentially add instead of the primitives that would make it possible for me to implement it myself however that solves only that problem and not any of the other reasons people might want the primitives,NONE
