1225594309,question,refactor vocabulary and consistency for hid reports,i want to disambiguate the that make use of report data and usage to describe the state of switches hid reports and their implementation for the different platformsdrivers i am also hoping to get comments on how wrong right i am about the analysis warning this is either partially or completely redundant with the introduction of xap tldr in the name of separation of concerns i propose refactoring of the hid report datastructures and their respective send functions in particular i am suggesting the usage of these terms and conventions for their specific cases hidreportfoot to describe a struct that contains at least uint8t reportid example c reporth typedef struct uint8t reportid uint8t attr1 uint16t attr2 attributepacked hidreportfoot ideally hidreportfoo would be a subsetimplementation of a hidreport like an abstract base class use descriptive names for the attributes of hidreportfoot example instead of data or usage use switchstate closedswitches reportedkeys or pressedbtns c reporth typedef struct uint8t reportid uint16t pressedkeys instead of usage attributepacked hidreportextrat hostfoosend and sendfoo have to use hidreportfoo as argument example c static void sendfoohidreportfoot hidreport warning the changes to functions arguments would be breaking non backwards compatible vocabulary confusion between different abstractions inconsistent vocabulary the words report data and usage are sometimes used interchangeably but not exclusively for a specific usage because they bleed out onto different data structures and meanings they can obfuscate each others purpose examples c reporth typedef struct uint8t reportid uint32t usage attributepacked c programmablebuttonc define reportbitindex uint32t1 index 1 static uint32t 0 void index reportbitindex void c hostc void report c vusbc here there is additionally the word data used static void data static report reportid reportusage data report sizeofreport and in the case of sendconsumer c typedef struct uint8t reportid uint16t usage attributepacked reportextrat c usbmainc static void sendextrauint8t reportid uint16t data static reportextrat report report reportextratreportid reportid usage data sharedinepnum uint8t report sizeofreportextrat void sendconsumeruint16t data data c hostc static uint16t lastconsumerreport 0 void report if report lastconsumerreport return lastconsumerreport report leading to mismatching interfaces if a report has a single field outside of reportid then the field is used instead of being wrapped in the report struct the reason might be to cut down on overall lines of code but i dont think it helps with the size of the final binary this means that all the driver interfaces have to know the underlying data structure and size to forward the call changes to data type and structure is therefore made more difficult examples send functions c chibiosc declarations uint8t keyboardledsvoid void report void report void sendsystemuint16t data void sendconsumeruint16t data void data void report c hosth host driver interface uint8t hostkeyboardledsvoid ledt void report void report void data void data void data and different implementations retracted this means the hid report is either created on the device driver side tmkcoreprotocol or on the side of the key processor quantum which is also an inconsistent behaviour i suggest to have all the hid reports 1 generated in the key processors quantum 2 forwarded through the appropriate channels sometimes through host driver 3 final drivers read the hid report and send packets example the mouse hid report is generated in the extra keys extrakeysenable using hostsystemsend or hostconsumersend have their hid report generated on the device driver eg using nondescriptive variable names when referencing the state of the switches the word data is often used as a stopgap term for single attribute hid reports especially for driver implementations at that stage the data does have a meaning and can benefit from a specific term among other benefits increased visibility makes it easier to lookup other definitionsusage of that term see article written against the usage of vague terms namesnaming additionally the attribute could be assigned a typedef if the type could be foreseen to change as it was for layerstatetlayert changing the size of the variable type could all be done from reporth every driver implementation probably needs to be updated anyway example c reporth typedef attr1foot uint16t typedef struct uint8t reportid attr1foot attr1 attributepacked hidreportfoot c hostc static attr1foot lastfooattr1 0 void hostfoosendattr1foot attr1 if attr1 lastfooattr1 return lastfooattr1 attr1 if driver return driversendfoousage finally i apologise if the overdocumentation comes across as condescending but i prefer to specify goal argumentation and examples as much as possible even when discussing with strangers of the internet that are way more knowledgeable than myself i would be happy to make those changes if they are deemed reasonable edit i made a mistake about assuming the hid report was generated from key processors in quantum xap naming abstract base class layert reporth,NONE

1224819101,question,add tcp route matching functionality to the v3 api,this functionality is relevant for the following example use case envoy is deployed as a forward tcpproxy i want to only proxy connections for specific combinations of destination ports ips i may have a very large number of these combinations eg i want to proxy any request to 1111 in the port range 20000 50000 based on my understanding of the v3 api in order to achieve the specific example above i need 30000 filter chains where the nth filterchainmatch looks something like destinationport 20000 n prefixranges 111132 this seems like overkill from a configuration perspective since each filter chain is otherwise identical terminates with a tcpproxy filter pointed at a single cluster while searching for better solutions to this specific use case i found for adding functionality to specify multiple routes within the tcpproxy filter it appears that this was implemented in v2 but abandoned for the v3 api is there a reason this functionality does not exist for v3 is it something that could potentially be added a separate alternative that would also address my use case would be to expand filterchainmatches to handle port ranges instead of just individual ports but im not sure what the scope impact of that change would be,NONE

1139066576,question,question with multiple voxel objects,hello absolutely amazing project you have here i was just wondering as i couldnt seem to find it anywhere in the documentation but is it possible to mix a smooth and blocky voxel world using two different voxelviewers i was looking to create something like space engineers with multiple grids separate from the main world and was looking to see if this is possible or feasible particularly with performance my original idea was to have multiple voxel worlds as i didnt see a way to do voxel objects these worlds would move and rotate independently of one another the thought behind this is it could allow for ships space stations and ground stations to all move around as well as interact with one another is that possible i would love to know if what i am thinking is possible as it could cut out a considerable amount of work on my end mainly i want to know can i have multiple ships stations and the planet together by having different worlds that can collide and interact with one another while being rendered separately and is there any way to have them render as they would if they were normal objects where for example if one ship is underground its impossible to see as the planet is covering it or if one ships is colliding with another the voxels possibly intermingled they display in the proper rendering order thank you and i hope you have an amazing day,NONE

1097075574,question,question about reducing integration time,hi i am trying to compute multiloop integrals which are very computationally expensive and was wondering if someone has some suggestions on how to evaluate them efficiently i have 1 2 and 3loop diagrams that i would like to evaluate the 3loop one is impractical to evaluate directly on the other hand my problem involves lowmomentum particles which makes an eikonal approximation a viable possibility to reduce complexity in this approximation a massive propagator with p21 and k the momenta of a soft photon reduces as pk2 11 2 p k1 my 1loop integral represents a triangle feynman diagram with 1 photon exchanged between two charged massive particles p12 p22 1 loopmomenta k1 externalmomenta p1p2 propagators k12p1 k12 1p2 k12 1 powerlist 1 1 1 the direct evaluation works fine and quickly with pysecdec and i would like to use this to test the eikonal approximation the eikonal version of this integral would be propagators k12 2 p1 k1 2 p2 k1 using splittrue or false i get results with 100 errors this issue was explained in issue 4 as being caused by poles that are not at the endpoints of integration and not contour deformed either a manual method to evaluate that integral by splitting the integral into 2 parts and changing variables was proposed however i wonder if there exists such a simple manual method for my 2 and 3loop diagrams as well my 2loop integral is propagators k1 2 k2 2 p1 k12 1 p2 k12 1 p1 k1 k22 1 p2 k1 k22 1 this takes about 10 hours of gpu time to get sufficiently small stat errors qmc integration method my 3loop integral is propagators k1 2k2 2k32 p1 k12 1 p2 k12 1 p1 k1 k22 1 p2 k1 k22 1 p1 k1 k2 k32 1 p2 k1 k2 k32 1 trying to evaluate this directly results in 328 sectors given the amount of time needed for the 2loop case i dare not try integrating this directly i hope that after implementing the eikonal approximation here the integration time would be greatly reduced but the above issue gets in the way i am using pysecdec version 152 and evaluating the integrals with a nvidia quadro rtx5000 gpu thanks for any help on how to proceed,NONE

1203937293,question,disabling labeler visualizations messes up semantic segmentation image name updates,hello i am currently working on a project on version 090preview2 i have modified the semantic segmentation labeler script so that the semantic image names reflect the parameters which are slightly modified on every iteration of the fixed length scenario of the current simulation so instead of using framecount i use another string which the script gets from another script that i have attached to the main camera which contains the new image name i have a randomizer that changes that image name on every iteration of the fixed length scenario the frames per iteration of which are set to 1 what i discovered today was that disabling the show labeler visualizations option of the perception camera in the editor increased the performance of my simulation improves by 2030 fps which is obviously very desirable however i found out that the semantic segmentation image names are not properly updated if that option is disabled for example if i had 3 rgb images named 1111010png 1111020png 1111030png i would only have 2 semantic segmentation images named 1111010png 1111030png meaning that one image was not captured or had been overwritten i added the framecount in front of the semantic image names in order to test whether the image names are not updated on every frame after that the image names would be for example 11111010png 21111010png 31111030png where the first integer is the framecount as you can see while the framecount was properly updated the image names are sometimes not updated on each frame only for the semantic segmentation labeler as far as i understand and i may be completely wrong is called from the onendframerendering function in the perception camera script which i would imagine is called on every frame after all the randomizers have run i printed the changed image names in the onendframerendering function and they were all correct since my randomizer that changes the image names does so on every frame and since the rgb images are renamed properly and the image names were printed correctly as mentioned above i do not understand how or why the semantic segmentation images are not is this a bug or an issue i might have caused or have i misunderstood how and when the semantic segmentation images are captured hopefully i have provided enough helpful information concerning my issue,NONE

769798252,question,raiseeventasync fails to determine the correct orchestration status,description given an application which uses suborchestration for frequent polling of an external service the suborchestration invokes an activity which sends the request to a servicebus instance and keeps waiting for an external event the remote service receives the request message and sends back the response to the same servicbus instance the response message is processed by a sb triggered function and it sends the response body back to the suborchestration by raising an event a retryoption is configured for the suborchestration like this csharp await new 150 handle e readinessrequest the suborchestation triggers the retry mechanism by throwing an exception as long as it gets unexpected response basically this is the polling mechanism note due to some security gates its not possible to simply invoke the remote service with http call image expected behavior the receiver function raises the event without any error so the suborchestration can continue the process actual behavior during this polling mechanism the receiver function sometimes fails to raise the event with one of the following exceptions no instance with id was found cannot raise event for orchestration instance because instance is in failed state as the issue happens occasionally i suspect the problem is the state synchronization of the suborchestration in the storage account as it throws exceptions and keeps retrying the orchestration state changes quite frequently from failed to running and it maybe out of sync when the fired is there any way to improve this so the raiseeventasync will detect the latest and uptodate status without delay known workarounds exponential retry of raising the event to the suborchestration but this slows down the polling mechanism app details durable functions extension version eg v183 222240 azure functions runtime version 10 or 20 v3 programming language used c screenshots if applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem if deployed to azure deployed in aks in the actual behavior there are 2 orchestration ids,NONE

1127103780,question,confirmation of timeout behavior and pingpong keepalive mechanism,so ive been reading the docs on timeouts pingpong keepalive mechanism and some not very verbose error messages looking at you connection closed no reason the below post is primarily from a client perspective as opposed to as a prelude the docs on sent 1011 unexpected error keepalive ping timeout no close frame received mention that this would either happen in case of packet loss or very high traffic that the client is unable to process in time which appears to be equal to the ping timeout value specified the discussion on timeouts mentions this if traffic spikes cause unwanted timeouts and you’re confident that the server will catch up eventually you can increase pingtimeout or you can disable keepalive entirely with pingintervalnone my question is if i disable keepalive mechanism entirely with pingintervalnone does that mean the ws connection now does not have any other mechanism of keeping the connection alive as the above quote says this will help in sudden high traffic situations where we know the clientserver will eventually catch up but does this affect what happens when there is little to no activity on a stream will having no keepalive at all cause disconnection of the stream because there is no pingpong or will it continue to stay connected thanks p s,NONE

1117615861,question,consider how to collapse similar rules into a single generic rule,regarding making the rules more generic i dont have a strong opinion at the moment ive been working on the mod mostly in an agile way with the belief that the right approach for a few different things will become clear as time goes on imho whatever we get to work works for me especially for the first iteration of the mod rules that require game patching like multiple zaps may be hard to generalize as the the code that needs to be patched may be generated differently by the game ie either different methods need to be patched or the routines to hook into are slightly different per ability etc but rules that dont require an onpatch method should indeed be much simpler to make generic with regards to when a rule can handle multiple cases for the sake of static typing and efficiency perhaps a typed structure instead of json would be beneficial as far as arguments to rule constructors go eg using either straight up primitive types a map etc thinking about down the road if we want users to configure rules via say some text file json or some subset of json makes sense rulesapi could parse the structure and then feed it to the rules constructor in a more typed fashion a map one concern may be input validation and ease of use for example it would be easier for users to type 20 and then again for each class instead of trying to write some jsondict but thats probably easily fixed with simple documentation additionally in order for rulesapi to know that the user passed in invalid values eg mispelled sorcrrer 20 the rule will have to perform some validation on arbitrary strings and propagate an error which rulesapi will have to catch and act on thats not necessarily difficult but does mean an additional layer of logic to maintain just a thought exercise if in the future for example if there were a ui that could expose settings for all rules it would need welldefined rule parameters in order for it to automatically generate a view with the name of the rule and each rule parameter to tweak for example it could tell via reflection that for rule there is a single int parameter labeled health and it could generate that entry in the ui appropriately it would be more difficult for it to know what to generate if the rule took in a json or even a typed map one way around this could be using welldefined structs like classes or what c calls records instead of jsonmaps however that in turn make instantiating rules slightly more difficult and verbose hmm perhaps a good inbetween solution could be for rules to accept only primitive types ie int string double etc and only as direct parameters but with as many parameters as it needs the health adjusted rule could then be implemented with a constructor signature of something like guardianhealth int sorcererhealth and could set defaults if need that way were still very statically typed allowing rulesapi core to know what parameters and their types are expected without requiring rules themselves to perform validation the flattened parameter list doubles as documentation imho easytodocument code is directly correlated with its simplicity and maintainability user input via config can still be in some jsonlike format with the keyvalue pairs corresponding exactly to the namestypes of the parameter list,OWNER

1298409501,question,add skiff discussion,skiff threat model skiff unlike most other collaboration workstations provides private and secure collaboration skiff’s threat model is an adversary that according to them may access any data sent over a network to or from a client even data sent over encrypted network connections it also assumes that data stored with a cloud provider cannot be assumed to be confidential tor signup this is possible but you may encounter things such as regular captchas and other annoyances but that wouldnt make it unusable they dont have a tor v3 onion service skiff is an ecosystem much like googles products it has both a free and priced pro tier from which you can benefit from its use of extended version history for files more options for collaboration etc but payment isnt required and isnt necessary for base usage they offer an email extension in terms of its reach not an actual extension for your browser ie it offers its own collaboration email that functions like a server email pages for creating wikis and other documents and a google driveesque product that overall has the ability to perform much like google docs but with the addition of data protection and privacy enhancing techniques the product is opensource on top of this i dont know whether this is the full source for everything yet skiff is a document editor at its roots similar to google docs it allows you to write edit and collaborate in real time with colleagues with privacy baked in skiff doesn’t have the ability to access anyone’s data and most if not all metadata only users and those who are invited to collaborate do it’s an idea that has already attracted the attention of investors skiff’s cofounders andrew milich ceo and jason ginsberg cto announced today that the startup has raised 37 million in seed funding2 from venture firm sequoia capital just over a year since skiff was founded in march 2020 alphabet chairman john hennessy former yahoo chief executive jerry yang and eventbrite cofounders julia and kevin hartz also participated in the round skiff isn’t that much different from whatsapp or signal which are also endtoend encrypted underneath its document editor “instead of using it to send messages to a bunch of people we’re using it to send little pieces of documents and then piecing those together into a collaborative workspace” the cofounders acknowledged that putting your sensitive documents in the cloud requires users to put a lot of trust into the startup particularly one that hasn’t been around for long that’s why skiff published a whitepaper with technical details of how its technology works and has begun to open source parts of its code allowing anyone to see how the platform works milich said skiff has also gone through at least one comprehensive security audit and the company counts advisors from the signal foundation to trail of bits products w e2e encryption mail pages drive availability skiff is currently available through any browser ios app android app mac desktop app document types supported you can upload docx pdf or md files or import documents directly from your google docs using our instant migration tool you can also embed files of any type into your skiff pages for collaborators to download read more about skiff’s file embeds here commands “” commands allow you to access all the cool features skiff has to offer without lifting your hands from your keyboard by hitting the “” key on your keyboard a dropdown list of commands will pop up for your selection select commands such as “code” to insert a code block “equation” to insert a mathematical equation and many more awesome features document encryption every document is associated with a shortterm symmetric sessionkey as well as an asymmetric “hierarchical” keypair the sessionkey is used to encrypt all document contents and metadata that are stored on the server in order to support realtime collaboration and simple sharing mechanisms all collaborators say alice and bob have access to the same sessionkey however because alice and bob have different asymmetric key pairs they each have unique encrypted copies of the same session key encrypted with publickeyalice and publickeybob respectively using this symmetric sessionkey we can outline processes for creating editing and sharing documents a document’s hierarchical key can be used for constructing a scalable filesystem out of many thousands of documents document history you can always use the version history feature to view and restore previous versions of your pages free tier users can look back up to 24 hours account recovery when users forget their password it’s convenient for them to have a way to recover their account and reset their password this is achieved using a recovery key a symmetric key similar to the a user can enable account recovery in their settings which generates a recovery key the recovery key is used to encrypt the user’s private data ie private keys this encrypted user data is stored by skiff but inaccessible,COLLABORATOR

1268678377,question,question is it possible to have fieldsboolean failing on 10 or other numeric types etc,the reason i ask is ive seen an api bug in the past where i naively had fields set as boolean where the api response was explicitly true false however we regressed and i missed a case as the api started returning 1 and with bool being a subclass of int this slid through until it hit production and our customers found it while probably using an api wrapper that was not written in python or was more strict i noticed the truthy falsy parameters which seemed appealing however they use in checks and 10 in true is still fine when setting truthytrue for example i opted for a new fieldfield that checks value is true or value is false inside both serialise and deserialise which works nicely i called it strictboolean is there a better way for handling such a case i had a look at the validators too which i guess creating my own validator subclass would be a good idea too but i think its already converted to the true false type before call is executed there too so when loading a field with value 10 a validator on a boolean field will receive true as its value is this something that would be open to having an option for as part of the built in fields or if there is a better way to manage it please let me know thanks a lot for the hard work in marshmallow edit i also cannot see discussions enabled so apologies if this is the wrong place for a question,NONE

1187708830,question,rawhid intermittently crashes when connected directly to usb but doesnt when connected through a hub,hey there im implementing a computercontrolled rgb matrix custom effect essentially a music visualiser im using the canvas ctrl keyboard by massdrop and for the most part implementing this has been smooth im now pretty close to publishing my work along with the companion application that handles audio processing and communication with the keyboard and want to make sure its robust and ive been running into an intermittent crash my changes are published on my fork as a sidenote if anyone is interested in trying out the visualizer for themselves andor helping me debug contact me on discord ruu9999 and ill share the companion application that currently supports only windows im using raw hid to push visualizer update messages to the keyboard which is a 64byte message sent at 60 updates a second at times the leds will be pushed from minimum to maximum brightness very quickly as you might imagine in the past ive seen qmk automatically scale back led brightness in reaction to power supply issues which ive fixed by connecting my keyboard directly to my pcs usb 20 port rather than going through a long extension cable hub up until i made that change i never ran into any crashingfreezing issues now im finding that the keyboard randomly crashesfreezes when it is running the visualiser sometimes it happens only after a few minutes of uptime sometimes its up to an hour ive done tests where ive disabled the led output using rgbtog but left the companion app running sending hid messages and it doesnt crash at all ive enabled debugging and watched the qmk toolbox debug feed but when it crashes no messages are sent windows still thinks the usb device is connected whenever this happens and i dont see any errorsmessages logged in usblogview the keyboards leds remain powered on when the crash happens and the frame it crashes on seems unremarkable to me ie not particularly brightintense so my current theory is that even though im now using a usb port that can keep up with the power demand the spikiness of the power draw causes some kind of brownout that gcr is unable to catchprotect against i would not write off my motherboardusb controllerpower supply as possible causes but i dont know of many easy ways to practically debug this at this point im trying to check if my own code is crashing when handling the hid messages by validating the message length and setting the keyboard to display red when a malformed message is detected so far though ive not learned anything new im also going to run tests where i lower the max brightness by one step at a time to see if that impacts the behaviour at all ill also try other usb ports and see if that changes anything really all im trying to work out is if this is a problem with my pc motherboard usb controllers or if its a genuine code crash that i can fix any ideasadvice,NONE

1091049612,question,set coco pretrained yolov5 input size to native resolution 4k how does this affect predictions,search before asking x i have searched the yolov5 issues and discussions and found no similar questions question hi i usually use your coco pretrained yolov5x model to test on my datasets to check the predictiontest performance these datasets usually have imagesvideo frames of high resolution usually 4k and even 8k sometimes even 240 pixels and contains usually small objects when i increase the input resolution to the native resolution in some cases it looks visually not tested on ap score that is able to detect almost all the objects i need to detect which is good news but i want to have a better understanding if this is a good habit or if i actually should tile the frames to the models native training input resolution of 640x640 my quick thoughts are that the model multiscale prediction grid is expanded and becomes less finegrained and thus harder to detect small objects or objects that are densely packed and thus should not be the way to go and therefore should i better tile the input images in the native trained input resolution if this is correct or not could you provide a better theoretical explanation i am focusing mainly on datasets that contain daily small images of area sizes in the range of 832 pixels in the huge images resizingsubsampling those images to the native training resolution will almost remove the small images therefore the images should be processed as much as possible on the native resolution if you agree with this what would be the best training strategies tiled training native training resolution of 640640 and tiled prediction upscale the model input to dataset images eg 4k 8k etc and train a model on the resolution eventually change the grinds settings to have a more finely grid prediction with the full resolution tiled training but full native dataset resolution prediction other better suggestions,NONE

1091676565,question,question using version 11711 with java 17 how to run multiple servers on 1 ip,what would you like to know i am attempting to run a machine with multiple minecraft worlds on it one as atm6 11711 the other as vanilla mc 1181 i have two main questions 1 how to run atm6 with a different java version 2 how to alter the server properties to run two servers on one ip address for the first question i saw a related post that talked about forcing atm6 to use a different java version than the native java 11 however i wasnt sure how to proceed as i am not too familiar with ubuntu and all of this now i know the first comment will be why run atm6 on java 17 that is because minecraft 118 requires that version of java or newer i have already managed to update the version of java to java 1701 20211019 lts and gotten the vanilla server to run on its own prior to the java version update i did have atm6 running fine on this machine so i should have a good base to work from for the second question i have seen a few posts about running multiple minecraft servers on one ip that involved changing the port numbers and opening a new port to forward in the routermodem i plan on making the 1181 world port 25566 instead of the default 25565 what precisely would i need to change in the serverproperties file just the server port or would i have to change the query port rconport too and how would i tell users to put in the ip at their computers would it be like this 11122234425566 thank you in advance and i look forward to learning more about all of this,NONE

1160814525,question,discussion pinning versions,right now apko installs the latest version of each package in the config file this means that every time a build is done the latest version of each package is used updates happen implicitly this approach has a few tradeoffs fast updates are great for picking up security fixes in a timely manner are simple to operate and do in apko but they can make posthoc analysis sboms more difficult introduce another attack vector a compromised distro has rce on your system this issue is to discuss whether the ability to pin versions is useful and how it should be implemented handwavy idea somehow persist each independent package version forever i think slsa has a recommendation for storage lifecycle use a tufstye snapshot role to generate up to date indexes of latest versions allow specific version pinning in an apkolock style file while still allowing users to specify just latest we shouldnt need any real constraint handling or sat solving the two choices are just a specific version or latest have a simple command to update a lock file and throw that into dependabot or similar to update very day i have no idea what this would look like in apk2 or 3 though so im probably missing something other considerations im not certain whether the alpine repositories persist old versions of packages wed need to keep them around somewhere to make this work,NONE

1361253387,question,cache control policy for html is surprising and a bit hard to work around,i realized after setting up staticwebserver to serve my website that subsequent updates wouldnt be applied and eventually found out that it was because html files are cached for one day by default this seems a bit surprising as standard practice afaik for web apps is to not cache the html since it was serving the cached html it was fetching the old js too from the tags in the cached html which either gets old javascript if that route is cached or fails to fetch the js if thats been cleared from the browsers cache the version of my web app that i served had a pretty visible bug so some users are stuck with that for a day no big deal to me just highlighting the negative effects of people running into this maybe this is specific to my use case spas so not sure about default behavior but the other side of this is that its going to be somewhat difficult to work around with the current customization options i think ill have to add my own rules for cache control since i cant use a glob pattern to match all requests for html or maybe this is possible w glob patterns but a quick search seems to suggest theres no way to say requests that dont have an extension to add a custom cache control header for that using the custom http headers ideally id like to just use the cache control stuff thats set up by default but specify that html files shouldnt be cached since setting up the pagefallback thing and having no cache control for the html is going to be universal among spas maybe a spa mode that does both and maybe theres other things to do would make sense staticwebserver spa anyway just rambling now feel free to close if this seems irrelevant theres no real bug here after all besides that one hiccup this is an amazing project im so happy to not have to tear my hair out over nginx super easy to setup and working flawlessly appreciate the hard work thats gone into it edit ive found out you can add meta tags to the html that serve the same purpose as disabling cache control headers which makes this a nonissue for me again feel free to do nothing about this nonbug just my experience and 2 cents,NONE

1093093014,question,support export balance dataset from imbalance source,hi thanks for the great effort im using transfer learning for training an object detection model the model convered 3 classes people bicycle custom sign the people and bicycle will get from public dataset like pascal voc which the amount is big while the custom sign is a private dataset with very small amount say 1000 images with a single label in each as the training tool requires a balance dataset for each class for achieve a good accuracy so im planning import the full pascal voc and custom dataset into 2 cvat tasks （2 tasks are in one project after labeled the custom sign data when doing the export i expect the exported i prefer the format kitti dataset can achieve limited classes as pascal voc has 20 classes here i only want export people bicycle and plus custom sign balance distribution for that 3 classes as pascal voc has thousands data for each class for balancing with custom sign each class need to align with amount 1000 does the tool now support this,CONTRIBUTOR
1130846386,question,is there or should there be a mapping between the securityseverity and problemseverity metadata properties,according to this is how securityseverity and problemseverity are defined the level of severity of nonsecurity alerts error–an issue that is likely to cause incorrect program behavior for example a crash or vulnerability warning–an issue that indicates a potential problem in the code or makes the code fragile if another unrelated part of code is changed recommendation–an issue where the code behaves correctly but it could be improved the level of severity between 00 and 100 for queries with tags security for more information about calculating securityseverity see the github changelog it seems strange to me that some queries like snprintfoverflowql for example can have high severity scores 81 in this case but not have a problemseverity of error is there any mapping between these two and if not should there be,CONTRIBUTOR

953424374,question,different sizes between finetuned model and pretrained model,redquestionmark questions and help what is your question hi when i check the model size of my finetuned model and your provided pretrained model i notice they are different mainly for multilingual translation model like models in there are two major dicts in the checkpoint ie model and lastoptimizerstate if both are in fp32 the size of lastoptimizerstate should be roughly as twice big as model since there are first and second momentums in the adam optimizer for the pretrained model you offered the sizes are for pretrained mm100175m the size of model 336m the size of lastoptimizerstate 14g for pretrained mm100615m the size of model 12g the size of lastoptimizerstate 47g it makes sense because the pretrained model is in fp16 and the lastoptimizerstate in fp32 the size of lastoptimizerstate should be roughly as four times as the model however when i fintune the pretrained model i meet some problems 1 the model is saved in fp32 instead of fp16 even though i train with fp16 my training config is as below how should i save the model in fp16 2 the size of model and lastoptimizerstate are weird for finetuned mm100175m the size of model is 17g the size of lastoptimizerstate is 14g for finetuned mm100615m the size of model is 43g the size of lastoptimizerstate is 47g the sizes of model and lastoptimizerstate are comparable which is strange to me besides even though i manually change the float of model to half i can only obtain half size of the model that is still different with your pretrained model do you have any ideas for this issue i want to generate a model with small size code datapathtodata python tool data datasetimpl mmap arch dropout 01 attentiondropout 01 encoderembeddim 1024 decoderembeddim 1024 16 16 encoderffnembeddim 4096 decoderffnembeddim 4096 encoderlayers 12 decoderlayers 12 shareallembeddings restorefile pretrainedmodel task encoderlangtok src decoderlangtok langpairs langpairs criterion labelsmoothing 01 optimizer adam adameps 1e08 adambetas 09 098 fp16 fp16initscale 128 fp16scaletolerance 00 memoryefficientfp16 lrscheduler inversesqrt lr 8e04 warmupinitlr 1e07 warmupupdates 2500 maxtokens 2048 saveinterval 1 whats your environment fairseq version eg 10 or master master pytorch version eg 10 17 os eg linux linux how you installed fairseq pip source source build command you used if compiling from source pip install editable python version 37 cudacudnn version 101 gpu models and configuration 8x nvidia tesla v100 any other relevant information,NONE

435473036,question,discussion redesign config and metadata handling,many people including anarcat have suggested us moving away from using lua as config file syntax i share the same sentiment and would like to take a stab at this task it will be a tricky and painful process especially taking migration into account but i think it is something worth pursuing and will do a lot of good for the project long term for me there are mainly 4 goals 1 make it easier for other projectstools to interact with koreader config and book configs needless to say it is not fun to parse a subset of lua syntax in other languages 2 make book config update more robust and performant right now adding a new bookmark or highlight requires rewriting the whole config file if any crash happened in the middle of the write you can end up losing lots of data 3 avoid arbitrary code execution when reading config 4 remove lua as a hard dependency for the document handling core the biggest gain would be 1 2 and 3 are minor edgecases 4 is a very long term play and can be very controversial so i wont focus too much on it some previous discussion can be found here in my mind there are two types of config 1 config for human to readwrite reader setting config for this config type being able to add comment is important i think toml is a great choice yaml is acceptable both format are easy for a human to read and modify 2 config for machine book metadata status bookmark highlight etc for simplicity i will refer them as metadata going forward msgpackjson pretty standard serialization format we will need to add some tricks on top of it to make the update more robust and performant wal with merge on read possibly compacting sqlite we are already using it for stats plugin this provides the best performance and robustness but schema handling can be a pain and its definitely not inspectable by a human let me know whats your thought i will write up a proper design with migration plan if the rest of the community also think this is the right path going forward highlights from discussion sqlite browser is nice but still an annoying extra step but lets be clear id much rather have sqlite than something like messagepack or json because it brings new possibilities to the table instead of just added complexity i find yaml pretty terrible as a format human readable eh but human writable nope just look at the kobopatch threads on mr for the amount of people getting screwed by the weird indentation requirements toml looks much saner though and it took quite a bit of time to get it into that state so i also worry that this would be a potentially massively destructive endeavor,MEMBER

977100923,question,the value of ckm matrix,as far as i understand when iteratively determine the sm parameters at the high scale the scale one defined the smeft wilson coefficients the package uses the value of ckm matrix to fix the value of the yukawa coupling of fermions at ew scale which further influences the running of the wilson coefficients in the smeft assuming the whole iterative programme works then how do the ckm in this procedure extracted from the experiments the inclusion of some of the operators for example phiq3 and phiud will indeed change the w boson and quarks interactions which may alter the global fit of the ckm in those low energy meson decay experiments it seems to me that one cannot have a consistent matching between smeft and wet without considering running of wet down to the low energy scale to extract the ckm from the low energy flavor observables a naive and consistent way i could think of to determine the initial value of yukawa matrices at the high scale is to find their value such that they minimize the chi2 function of the global fit of the relevant low energy observable taking into account all the running and matching effects but i know this is computationally inapplicable so is there any way to analysis the theoretical uncertanties brought by possibly improper value of ckm i read a relevant thread but eager more thought and explanation of this problem thanks haolin,NONE

1147989392,question,static assets whats happening,i am really just looking for information around changes to static web assets in net 6 in net 5 there was a relatively simple ifileprovider implementation for static assets there was basically a manifest file with some root directories in and when your application ran the manifest was discovered and file providers were set up to serve content from these directories these file providers passed through much logic to physicalfileprovider which was quite nice because it was already a proven implementation of file provider it has support for watch and change notifications which is useful when serving from a local directory for example i have recently upgraded to net 6 and i have discovered that the old manifest file format has now been replaced by a newer format and a newer this new format of manifest file looks to expanded a great deal in its complexity and size i am seeing mine used to be 1kb in the new model its 284kb the new file provider seemingly looks a bit more complex and puts more logic in front of the underlying physicalfileprovider which was a proven implementation so ie risk of new bugs therefore increased with net 6 in this area the new file provider doesnt seem to support watch or change tokens anymore even though the underlying physical file providers are capable of this which seems a degradation in functionality from before eg it does this public ichangetoken watchstring filter therefore given these perceived negatives may i ask what the reason for the new provider and new manifest file is ie there must be reasons why it was necessary to make these changes it would be very helpful to understand what is accomplished in this new model of dealing with static assets also i would be interested to know why watch change tokens are deprecated thinking of the scenario in local development where you edit a content file in a locally referenced project i would have though watch would have been useful for enabling the app to respond or is this not really the case many thanks,NONE

1325795073,question,is the domain level independent of the ui layer,first of all thanks for the interesting example alex but id like to ask one question ive seen many attempts to implement clean architecture when working on web interfaces but actually i face the same problem every time the specific of the web development is that we want to update ui pointwise instead of rerendering the whole page and usually we use tools that allow us to do it effectively i mean react redux and mobx are the tools that allow us to do local ui updates right but we pay for that by using the api provided by these tools let me clarify what i mean on the example of your application why do you create a new cart object with a new product array here instead of mutating this its because react forces you to do this isnt it if you dont create a new copy react will not rerender your cart component but it means that the logic inside the domain layer depends on the ui layer if you decide to replace react with vuejs or for example if you decide just to add mobx to your react application approaches in the domain namespace will not work anymore or at least they will not work effectively thats why from my point of view clean architecture actually is not as perfect for the frontend apps as on paper what do you think about this,NONE

1160587291,question,launching host apps flatpak from container,is your feature request related to a problem please describe this is not really a bug or feature request most closely a support request i wanted to turn vs code settings sync on inside the distrobox container exporting the app from the container works well im still amazed how easy this is but since i didnt have a browser installed inside the container signing in to github wont work since vs code and a lot of other appstoo for similar purposes tries to open a browser describe the solution youd like im not sure if there is a reasonable solution for this since we are talking about containers i tried to search the issues from toolbox as well but didnt find any describe alternatives youve considered i managed to find 2 workarounds for now these are for a f35 toolbox image 1 install firefox and xdgutils inside the container strange enough this seems to open the signin tab on the host browser 2 manual method works at least with github signin launch code from the container with code verbose try to sign in and follow the logs outputted to the terminal the authorization uri will be there open that manually in the browser authorize and gh will give you a link to use in case redirecting back to the application wont work it wont since vs code is running in the container click the signing in to github in the bottom bar a dialog box will open asking for the uri paste the uri from github there additional context since after installing firefox inside the container the tab opened in the host flatpak browser i think there might be a way to circumvent installing a browser in the container its not that big a deal but would save space unfortunately i am not savvy enough with containers to figure this out i understand that this might be out of scope or just plain impossible please close if you think so,NONE

1118300474,question,groovy expression in jmeter file,ah ok so you should look at so basically you have two types of variables substitutions the one for groovy variables and one for jmeter variables since jmeter and has same syntax to substitute it can be confusing in general the rule is if you want groovy substitution you should use double quotes in any other case you should use single quotes in your case when you have argumentname varhost value jmthost you define varhost variable based on groovy variable jmthost and this substitution is only available during test plan build phase then defaultsprotocol http domain varhost port 1080 you use varhost variable define before during test plan execution note that groovy substitution you dont have use string interplation to get variable and just use the variable name it depends what you want to actually create as a variable originally posted by smicyk in,CONTRIBUTOR

1091301350,question,tojson vs serialize,id like to have some responses that contain a static string static str which are not deserializeowned so cannot be object however i dont need to be able to deserialize these only serialize them as they are only responses this lead me to think itd be nice to be able to do something like this rust deriveapiresponse enum response oaistatus 400 badrequestjson deriveserialize struct errorpayload code static str message string where json would accept any t which is serialize i tried a quick blanket implementation of impl tojson for t but is some refactoring work to be done in order to make that work before i go down that road i have a few questions 1 whats the motivation for tojson vs just using serialize serdejson everywhere i dont want to wander down this path and step in the same holes you probably already have 2 has that blanket impl already been attempted somewhere and if so are there any roadblocks id hit if i try similarly im going to struggle a bit with needing type as well im considering a derivetype which i could maybe steal from the object macro though realistically i think it just needs to inspect the type and pick the right basic impl eg object for a struct this could also maybe utilize serde but i figure that would be slow at runtime this isnt urgent im just going to use string for now but id like to avoid excess allocations at some point when i dont need them,CONTRIBUTOR
1087264390,question,c89 compatibility issues,while attempting to enable c89 compilation i ran into the following fundamental issues c89 does not support 64bit integers long long int 64bit integers are mainly used in the secure message lib to keep track of sequence numbers and ivs the timeout parameter is also 64bit luckily gcc supports long long int in c89 c89 does not support variadic macros this is mainly a debug library issue specifically the macro debugprintprintlevel the benefit of having it as a macro is that it can be optimized away via a define the alternative would be to ditch the macro and perform a function call directly to debugprint and rely on linktime optimizations to get rid of the function call if not needed so the question is how important is it to work around these limitations,CONTRIBUTOR

428317163,question,licence change,consider whether eupl is the most appropriate licence for mistra as i understand it the eupl was developed by the eu to cover the work of the commission and potentially of other eu funded projects while nothing prevents its adoption by other projects it seems an odd choice for mistra for the following reasons mistra is scientific software and by definition science is international with engliush as lingua franca therefore it is irrelevant whether the licence is fully compatible with eu law or translated into all the eu languages most of the users and developers past and present of mistra are or soon will be outside the eu this is not particularly important per se it just means an eu centered licence is not relevant the choice of eupl suggests that primary funding was coming from the eu but this is not the case only part of the work by j bock between 2015 and 2020 was funded by the eu most of the work before 2015 had other funding sources mistra is distributed with a customized version of kpp which is licensed under gplv2 from “under a strong copyleft license like gpl if you redistribute a program that includes gpl code written by others you must make your entire program available under gpl” technically kpp is a separate program but mistra cannot work without it it’s a bit of a grey area and using the same license avoids the potential confusion the eupl actually allows allow patent use see which was initially considered by the developers team as a disqualifying criterium for mistra i think mistra should be under a licence with global applicability and widely knownunderstood all over the world especially within the scientific community personally i think that it would be more appropriate to use either the gpl licence or if we want to be more permissive the mit or bsd licence see this website for more info from personal and public conversations most of the developers i spoke to don’t really care about the type of license among those who expressed an opinion there is a slight preference towards the gpl,COLLABORATOR

series of 4 tests on the same incremental code to measure the time taken to execute 500000 main loop cycles and calculate the relative speed the boards used are esp01s with chip esp8266 singlecore tensilica l106 80 mhz lolin s2 mini with chip esp32s2 singlecore xtensa lx7 240 mhz considering the characteristics of the chips as a result of the tests i expect a much higher speed of the esp32s2 chip the tests were performed on 4 sketch adding a new functionality to each one 1 in the first test the mainloop was empty without defining and calling other libraries esp32s2 was 56 times faster than esp8266 2 in the second test the definition of the wifi library was added and the connection to the network the mainloop was not changed esp32s2 was 56 times faster than esp8266 3 in the third test webserver httpupdateserver and wificlient libraries were added for the web ota functionality in the mainloop the call to the handleclient function has been added surprise esp8266 was 798 times faster than esp32s2 4 the fourth test was performed only for esp32 adding the call to enabledelayfalse first of the handleclient esp8266 was 12 times faster than esp32s2 only why is esp32s2 even

test score 010385626009480095 so even though i used same parameters for lgb native and sklearn api the sklean api result is horrible presumably because there are hidden parameters like in this old issue i think this solution is insufficient one should be able to get the full correct parameters from the cv trained class or internal list of boosters but even those internal boosters do not have the correct full parameters that is while the retrained single model lgbtrain data lgbtrain might have the required additional parameters one would have to save the booster to disk and reload which is unacceptable for large models ie or retrain twice once with native api and then sklearn api which is also unacceptable but in any case if i even try the excessive way nothing helps the original best parameters already has minchildsamples etc that in 2017 were missing,NONE

1161911034,question,can partially bound descriptors be destroyed while bound to an in flight command buffer,ref the spec says that partiallybound descriptors dont need to contain valid descriptors as long as the descriptor is not dynamically used does this imply that a descriptor that has been written can be destroyed as long as the descriptor is not dynamically used is pretty clear in that a buffer written to a descriptor set that is bound in a command buffer would create a reference to that buffer and that buffer cannot be destroyed while the command buffer is in flight but bindless partially bound descriptors are often exceptions to the rules and a clarification here would be appreciated,NONE

1110279375,question,measurement update dependent on cloned imu state,first up thanks for providing this amazing research platform i am trying to compare different update methodologies using vehicle speed and steering measurements for vehicles one of the methods is supposed to be implement via odometry preintegration as in section 21 of visualinertialwheel odometry with online calibration i am only interested in the odometry update without estimating odometry intrinsics and extrinsics i am having trouble to understand how to perform the ekf update with jacobians dependent on the last imu state at the beginning of preintegration period and the current imu state at the end of preintegration period in particular i dont know how to apply the jacobians equation 94 and equation 95 of visualinertialwheel odometry with online calibration in the openvins framework equation 94 is dependent on the imu state and equation 95 on the state of imu clones image i am following the scheme of other update classes and came up with this construct the jacobians stdvector hxorder the jacobian entries correspond to the last and current imu state but since hxorder is constructed by types only we take the types of the current imu state eq 94 first row eq 94 second row eq 95 first row eq 95 second row large final matrices used for update int hsize 12 int msize 3 eigenmatrixxd h hsize eigenvector3d res eigenmatrixxd r msize set the values of h is this the correct way of doing this and is it possible with the current version of openvins to perform an ekf update dependent on the cloned state the above method of updating seems to work at times but can also be quite unstable and state estimation diverges in these cases,NONE

1251934735,question,published blazor application not able to resolve promises inside blazorwebassemblyjs,is there an existing issue for this x i have searched the existing issues describe the bug hello all ive been using blazor to achieve something very specific heres a little context of what i am doing we have application written in net mvc with knockoutjs on the front end this application provides functionality to our users to only read the content off late we started receiving requests to have the content modified by the users however we started noticing that our existing application was out of date and we did not want to develop on it anymore that being said we wanted to build some components that would integrate seamlessly with current app and still allows us to move away from older tech thats where i decided to pursue blazor as the new tech to move forward within blazor app i started developing one component at a time and then i published the app to the root of existing application and all my blazor code started living under framework folder heres an entire article on how i am doing this assuming that you now understanding of what i am trying to do i am now going to jump to the issue i am facing i updated my net5 blazor app to net6 and with it i also updated package the update seemed to have no breaking changes when i ran the blazor app individually however when i published the application into the root of my host application i started seeing error where blazorwebassemblyjs was not able to load blazorbootjson file image upon lot of googling and researching i did not find the cause of it and hence i decided to unminify the complied blazorwebassemblyjs and decided to debug it line by line and i found out that the code that there might be a bug within the js file i am not sure of it the code that tries to load blazorbootjson never really completes the promise heres the code that breaks image i added await on line 1421 in front of function execution a and when the function actually resolves it sends a response that looks like this image the problem code seems to directly send the response instead of the actual url from the response heres the modified version that seems to work image if i do the above changes the code works fine and i am able to load the components inside other application successfully at this point i am not sure how the blazorwebassemblyjs gets generated so i am not sure if this is a bug or is it something to do with my approach of using blazor can someone please take a look and guide me if theres something i need to change in my approach i really love the way this has worked out for us because i am able to write multiple components within same blazor app and load them separately on demand from the old host application heres my programcs from blazor using using using microsoftjsinterop using system using systemnethttp using systemthreadingtasks using vmsvnextcomponents using using mudblazorservices namespace vmsvnext public class program public async static task mainstring args var builder var host builderbuild var jsruntime string component await ifcomponent null if component compliance ifcomponent storageexplorer new httpclient baseaddress new await builderbuildrunasync please let me know any more information is required thank you expected behavior no response steps to reproduce no response exceptions if any no response net version dotnet6 anything else no response,NONE

1109712009,question,do we need to collect comments from reviews on pull requests github collection,question do we need to collect comments from reviews of pull requests github collection additional context currently we are only collecting direct comments on pull requests if we want to collect comments from reviews of pull requests we need to make a new collection task to collect reviews on each pull request and also comments on each review before we answer this we must consider the cost on performance and rate limits github rate limits are already very low and this in my opinion would be a lot of requests for low value it would also add considerable time to collection on an already pretty slow process that being said i came across this fact while performing qa tasks and thought it was at least relevant enough to mention and have some discussion if it is something important to any prospective or current users this is probably a decision for startrekzky who may know more about business requirements,CONTRIBUTOR
1245044657,question,research how to implement rights changes in pywb,we have a requirement from apchan to support changing access rights to archived web content world stanford dark currently changes to seed object rights in argo only controls how things appear in searchworks and purl and has no effect on the visibility of content in swap currently openwayback crawl objects are all dark in sdr which has no effect on swap which makes their contents all available to the public it is possible to use blocks exclusions and user based access controls in pywb but it is unclear what work would need to be done to integrate changes in argo with changes in the pywb configuration this task is to come up with a design for that,CONTRIBUTOR

869945326,question,consider the structure of our documentation,sherpa has at least it feels like that more functions and ways to do the same thing than numpy or eg matplotllib even after contributing to the sherpa codebase a bit i still constantly discover new functions new parameters etc it often does not feel coherent and the fact that our docs are organized to be read by function docstrings ahelp see also to just skim the surface readthedocs text or in threads ciao website instead of systematically explain all options does not help threads are good as examples but if you want to do something just slightly different its hard to find out how because you dont know where to start looking and looking things up by function requires knowing what those functions are called i know its a lot of work to write good documentation and the fact that we serve two different communities through the standalone release and as part of ciao and then we have two totally different interfaces ui layer and oo does not make it easier still im missing pages like concept list concept concept and list in one page that explain the concept andor list all available options for one topic eg all plotting commands with a shot explanation what they do beyond the name of the function i get in he see also list is pretty close to what i have in mind but not complete in any sense because it again it meant to just skim the surface im not advocating to write that right now because thats too much work but id like to know or discuss if not yet decided what our vision for the future is can we unify the ciao website and readthedocs generate them from the same input files do we keep them totally separate one for the ui layer one for oo but increase linking between them where do we add more content where would a more systematic overview go i know dougburke has done a lot of work to unify docstrings and ahelp files and has probably thought about this,CONTRIBUTOR

1226371048,question,temurin java 64 bit floating point arithmetic and javalangstrictmath method error repairs,to temurin java jdkjre java runtimes generate floating point arithmetic or javalangstrictmath denormal and pronormal values as a result of source code like this they are an error phenomenon which can and aught be fixed the java language arithmetic only no comparisons import static javalangsystem public class start public static void mainstring args outprintlnprogram has started outprintln float a 01f float b 01f float c ab outprintlnc double d 01d double e 01d double f de outprintln outprintlnf outprintln outprintlnprogram has finished program has started 0010000001 0010000000000000002 001 program has finished ieee 754 doesnt specifically say anything about the base 10 digit degradation that can happen at the right hand side of floating point decimal number type variables or data in the openjdk float and double are the main examples however a similar problem occurs with javalangstrictmath method calls however all examples like this are logic errors that need to be repaired in either a default or mutual way simply because denary accuracy is required out of a compiled and running java program either at its conclusion or some mid point the computer hardware that the author has in mind is the desktop pc running any ubiquitous operating system or as configured as a database or internet server workarounds are used being biginteger bigdecimal and bigmath in java they introduce an entire tier to the java software which isnt ultimately needed they are slow and produce an avoidable loss in speed are larger in ram and dont allow the use of arithmetic operator source code syntax things that developers and their programs need the ieee should include or state something new in its standard 754 to encourage software vendors to act differently but if it doesnt the vendors will have to act on their own what seems to be required is one of two approaches the original equation from ieee 754 can be adjusted or disregarded instead of being followed into the negative exponents region the exponent of 2 can always be kept positive both for integers and decimals similarly the curve should reflect itself for integers and decimals through the vertical axis in this manner reciprocal powers of two are not generated and never create problems this scheme for floating point is an enhanced mirror of fixed point binary numerics however by following this ideal i have calculated an approx 18 reduction in decimal place range for java float and an approx 5 decimal place range redution for java double the other approach is patch the present circumstances with available hardware bit registers having two range limits for float and double values range limits and right hand side consideration range limits for decimals and their relationship to binary this has existed as extra sse registers and their descendants all of such does exist in the vast majority of relevant and ubiquitous compatible cpu hardware surely those registers can be leveraged to solve these values and their calculation problems this way accuracy of all possible decimal values can be maintained and degrading of the decimal digits can be kept outside the decimal value range limit with no range reduction at all at the decimal end consider what gnu c has done with sse and floating point decimal accuracy the c language arithmetic only no comparisons include include using namespace std int main cout program has started endl setprecision9 float a 01f float b 01f float c ab cout endl c endl setprecision2 multiplication count from left to right d 01f e 01f f de cout endl f endl setprecision18 double d 01d double e 01d double f de cout endl f endl cout endl cout setprecision2 multiplication count from left to right a 01d b 01d c ab cout endl c endl endl cout program has finished return 0 consider the following the ieee 754 floating point binary number formula n21s × m2 × 2e2 – 127 as is defined by the mantissa of the registry the exponent of the registry the sign of the number and the number which is now binary for a 32 bit or 64 bit hardware registry there is the option to reflect the positive part of the curve however that will reduce the range of the number types involved because this reduces numeric density within the curve but it will mean that no denormal or pronormal decimal values can occur and that the precalculating for number mapping will be more efficient for decimals than as present it would be most compatible to use an sse an additional bit registers approach to do further correct calculating and to offset the range of binary to decimal degredation the way that gnu c has achieved however things can be done compatabily there could be a patch program separate to the main java download trying not to change how the language compiled there could be a runtime switch which can be wrapped around previous java code there could be a manifest file entry for jarwarear files there could be an overhead static class that can be called for code spaces or all code spaces beneath a main method a thread start method futures or any similar something similar should be possible by using some original annotations but so long as the contents of a float and a double can read and write over one another both modes of operation could be used at the same time if things were set up consistently enough all that is presuming that the bold step of total default change isnt to be taken since the floating point errors occur in the decimal unit in the last place and that any such result breaks the contiguous range property to a ranged denary number line who could possibly in any meaningful way be needing and relying on a floating point error situation is the temurin able to update its jdk and jre offerings for all platforms to either repair at default or at compatibility these floating point errors,NONE

1282249320,question,ram confusion and question,board espwroverkit device description custom board with a lot of peripherials hardware configuration custom hardware with a lot of peripherials version latest master checkout manually ide name platform io operating system windows 10 flash frequency 80mhz psram enabled yes upload speed 115200 description im using a lot of things in my code i have a lot of classes char arrays tasks and i use a lot of arduinojson documents using peripherials like ethlan8720 st7735 display and ds3231 and a lot of hardware things and ofc since this is a chip supposed to focus on iot i use a lot of https requests and sslwebsocket connections i have to save ram in every corner of my code but my confusion starting from here my esp has 4mb external ram currently it is using 210kb ram which was allocated from the internal memory and using 618kb from external ram i attached a picture for reference which is from the esps admin page where i can live monitor the resources image im in a situation where i have to maintain an ssl websocket connection with a nodejs server trought socketio meanwhile the esp has to ask the same server for filefirmware upgrades which uses https and an other to download if there are new versions the problem with that is the tls implementation allows me only one ssl connection at a time so what i have done to get rid of this problem i drop the websocket connection for the duration of the https requets and reinitializing it after that with newly pulled ca from the filesystem this causes some serious memory fragmentation because everything uses my internal memory so as you can see while i have no internal memory left the chip sits there and looking at my 34 megabyte external memory while crashing on an ssl handshake because the internal memory so fragmented it can not allocate enough space for a new connection why isnt it throws an error or allocates from the external ram for the ssl instead of crashing with an mbedtlssslreadrecord error you ask i dont know and it seems to me that nobody has any idea why so you say i just have to allocate enough ram for every unknown sized packet that comes on a socket if you can tell me a safe size for the packets to allocate and you can promise that my software will never crash because there is not enough space allocated for the message i will gladly do that but as long as i cant do such a thing i have to rely on dynamic allocation which ofc will fragment my heap no matter what i do so there are a couple of questions in my mind why cant it allocate memory from my external ram if there is not enough space in internal is there a flag where i can tell the rtos or whatever allocates the memory to always use my external ram is there any garbage collection feature that i dont know of they say it would slow the chip down i would take that risk if it would ensure that my heap will not be fragmented can i lower the barrier which handles the ram allocation process sketch cpp just put a lot of ssl requests into here is my current problem boolean char path const char url if ismounted return false boolean success false char cacasize if

1083376102,question,why are some of the registers stored as tuples in the python binding,i noticed using the python binding for unicorn some of the registers are stored as tuples for example ucx86regfp00 0 ucx86reggdtr0 0 0 0 ucx86regldtr0 0 0 0 ucx86regtr0 0 0 0 at first i thought well maybe these registers are flags and its more efficient or perhaps just easier to work with if we store manipulate them in pieces so i looked into some of them to see if this guess made sense particularly gdtr and ldtr memory management registers — the gdtr idtr task register and ldtr specify the locations of data structures used in protected mode memory management see chapter 2 “system architecture overview” in the intelregistered 64 and ia32 architectures software developer’s manual volume 3a so in that section 211 global and local descriptor tables when operating in protected mode all memory accesses pass through either the global descriptor table gdt or an optional local descriptor table ldt as shown in figure 21 these tables contain entries called segment descriptors segment descriptors provide the base address of segments well as access rights type and usage information it goes on and maybe im missing something but i dont see why these registers would benefit from being broken into pieces so it seems like that theory is wrong each segment descriptor has an associated segment selector a segment selector provides the software that uses it with an index into the gdt or ldt the offset of its associated segment descriptor a globallocal flag determines whether the selector points to the gdt or the ldt and access rights information to access a byte in a segment a segment selector and an offset must be supplied the segment selector provides access to the segment descriptor for the segment in the gdt or ldt from the segment descriptor the processor obtains the base address of the segment in the linear address space the offset then provides the location of the byte relative to the base address this mechanism can be used to access any valid code data or stack segment provided the segment is accessible from the current privilege level cpl at which the processor is operating the cpl is defined as the protection level of the currently executing code segment see figure 21 the solid arrows in the figure indicate a linear address dashed lines indicate a segment selector and the dotted arrows indicate a physical address for simplicity many of the segment selectors are shown as direct pointers to a segment however the actual path from a segment selector to its associated segment is always through a gdt or ldt the linear address of the base of the gdt is contained in the gdt register gdtr the linear address of the ldt is contained in the ldt register ldtr 2111 global and local descriptor tables in ia32e mode gdtr and ldtr registers are expanded to 64bits wide in both ia32e submodes 64bit mode and compatibility mode for more information see section 352 “segment descriptor tables in ia32e mode” global and local descriptor tables are expanded in 64bit mode to support 64bit base addresses 16byte ldt descriptors hold a 64bit base address and various attributes in compatibility mode descriptors are not expanded so if not to make it easier to work with registers that hold multiple separate pieces of information why are some of these stored as tuples in case its unclear how im arriving at these values heres my code the values are read assigned at class cpustate keystone the ultimate assembler from keystone import capstone the

1270658917,question,exceptions not caught in linux shared library built with libc,my team is developing a c shared library that is primarily used from c through pinvoke we have noticed a weird behavior with exceptions in the c code on linux where the following method c extern c void test try throw stdruntimeerrortest catch stdexception e stdcout exception caught ewhat n catch stdcerr unknown exception caughtn does not catch the stdexception but instead printsout unknown exception caught when invoked from c the code above works as expected when test is invoked from a c unittest executable that was also built with libc we have since diagnosed the issue to how the cxaallocateexception is resolved our shared library built with libc will reference the cxaallocateexception symbol as df und 0000000000000000 base cxaallocateexception when the c unittest executable loads our shared library the cxaallocateexception is resolved from ⁠⁠libcabiso1 as expected g df text 000000000000004b base cxaallocateexception and everything works fine however when our shared library is executed from c the process that loads first is actually dotnet which requires ⁠libstdcso6 0x00007f54d1b0b000 so before our library is even loaded libstdc will be loaded and will resolve cxaallocateexception to its own implementation g df text 000000000000005f cxxabi13 cxaallocateexception when our library is finally loaded the cxaallocateexception is already resolved to libstdc but presumably some other exceptionrelated symbols are still unresolved and they are taken from libc we therefore endup with a mix of libc and libstdc implementations in our shared library a thing that is not obvious is unwanted and probably is also very dangerous in terms of behavior the only workaround we have so far is to statically link libc into our shared library as well as hide all its symbols so they are never resolved by the dynamic loader but it feels very hacky to have to do this is there an alternative cleaner fix,NONE

1190749470,question,extra data parameters,just used your script to fix my friends 2011 imac with i7 and 16gb ram now running xubuntu and virtualbox with monterey he is very excited had a problem with the video which lead me to look at the parameters adjusted the graphics resolution to match the imacs and now it works flawlessly so comparing stock creations of macos guests none of these extra parameters are present the only difference i can see is the ostype which seems to be the release number and processor ie macos101364 for high sierra i see that you set that parameter in your script on the vms that i upgraded from catalina to monterey i had gone back and set the os type to just macos64 with the gui and noticed no difference a number of the other values that you set do show up in the about this mac screen and i assume they account for why your script works so flawlessly some of them seem very specific like dmibardproduct and others seem rather whimsical like dmisystemuuid cafecafecafe etc which i take must be a series of hex digits separated by hyphens in specific groups i even changed a couple of them slightly to see if they had any effect and they didnt seem to i stayed with hex numbering of course so my question i would like to understand the significance of these extra data items that you add into the virtual machine where could i find that information clearly a couple of them are immutable like dmisystemvendor but others look like they might be adjustable and if they are what would be the effect secondly reading the script it seems to me although im not clear yet that you create a recovery partition to restore the os to the new vm disk but when it is done there is no longer a recovery disk i ask because when we ran the script for the imac my friend mistakenly interacted with the os during installation and we had to start over we found left behind what seemed to be a recovery disk image sadly we were pressed for time and i didnt really get to study it so my question is there a recovery disk created during the installation and could it be saved and attached to the vm just like the recovery disk is on a physical mac there is a recovery vmdk for mojave floating around on the net and i have attached it and used it to get to recovery on a vm i restored a physical lion from a machine to a vdi in a virtual machine and it worked sorry to be a nuisance but your work has mad it possible to experiment with all kinds of interesting things with macos and vb any info you care to provide would be appreciated,NONE

1113467150,question,how to have a single app that updates data in reapit via backend and is able to view the data using a client ui integrated to the desktop,summary looking for advice on how best to implement auth we are building a marketplace app that continuously syncs contacts from another system into reapit the app has a backend that reads contacts from the source system and creates contacts in reapit the source system has additional fields that get added as metadata on the contact in reapit we need a way for the users to view that metadata in the agencycloud desktop we used the createreactapp template to create a ui and integrate it via contact type to the desktop the ui opens up a page that retrieves the metadata from the contact and shows it to the user it appears that the ui needs to use the authorization code flow to get access to reapit api to get the contact data the problem is that we also need to have the backend that does the syncing also authorised with the api we thought about saving the access token of the first person to installopen the app and use that for sync operations in the backend but this seems like a hack and hasnt exactly worked yet it seems like having the backend use the client credentials flow would be the best approach but from what im reading here having the same app use both flows is not supported whats your advice on how to handle this situation requiring users to install two apps is not great thank you detail and or supporting links and screenshots,NONE

1113408820,question,module federation sync load support,bug report so i would like to create this ticket to give more visibility to and see if we can finally get this fixed what is the current behavior crash with error uncaught error shared module is not available for eager consumption if the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce this is a repository to reproduce the problem yarn yarn start its using lerna what is the expected behavior this should works in sync ways without the requirements of bootstraps or lazy imports other relevant information webpack version latest 567 nodejs version 1613 operating system ubuntulinux additional tools scriptedalchemy alexanderakait sokra hi i would like to revive this topic after few days debugging the whole sharing modules i think we can do some changes to make sync works basically the main problem is screenshot from 20220124 025424 when we do the initial load and we try to load shared dependencies like react in this example this is trying to call the next code react webpackrequire react logically this is wrong because in the initial load we should not wait for the chunk instead of that dependencies should be loaded and stored in cache and when this be required by chunks we should be able to read the cache to get the references the second things is that this should be considered a cascade imports screenshot from 20220124 030456 i was trying to fix it but im not very involved in the core of webpack but after debugging this im thinking that the fix should not be too complicated to make mf be able to work in sync mode and can be optional with props to keep original functionality like is actually the reason that mf works async is because primitive dependencies from nodemodules are already loaded but this doesnt make sense if from the beginning we dont have access to them basically the host must have it loaded but the logic should not require to have eager enabled this can be refactored to works in a better way to support scenarios like scenario1 host1 host2 plugins scenario2 host1 plugins what we should check if in the initial load shared dependencies arent loaded if thats the case should be loaded when we works based on shared we should consider that the host should provide these shared dependencies to keep some armony between dependencies if not the plugin have the opportunity to load it from his bundle the main file where the problem i think is located is this one the main problem is webpack and how he negotiate the shared resources and thats why im suggesting it and about versions can be designed in the way that we can store the versions also and if the shared that is expecting the child mf plugin or the chunk is not there we can implement a way to continue loading it in the current way getting this from nodemodules at high level should be like this user story app entry point chunk1 chunk2 and will load as mf plugin1 config react will be singleton how webpack should manage this complex scenario in sync way something like this image 53 webpack load process and negotiations should be based on tree logic the first one that loads a shared dependency can be considered the host when this is configured as singleton and works based on cache if a mf plugin or chunk or anything else is trying to load a shared library and the version dont match should load it and store it in the cache and keep the same flow in any case if u want to use same resource across the whole execution this should keep using requiredversion false and also this can solve the problem about run the whole stuff in sync way and finally remove the bootstrap hack way that is being used to make it works but it does present a challenge to start an application if the dependencies are not hoisted and frontloaded asynchronously i believe there is a workaround that if you use sharekey and import and give the object some key other than react like fakereact it wont move out of the graph into another chunk however you are then in host only mode similar to eagertrue if a shared resource is remote we can detect it and also we could add new attributes in webpack config to make it explicit but to be honest shared singleton shouldnt be remote for remote we have explicitly remotes new name app1 filename remoteentryjs remotes app2 app2 exposes button srcbutton sharing code based on the installed version to allow for multiple vendors with different versions shared react singleton true requiredversion false reactdom singleton true requiredversion false reactredux singleton true requiredversion false hopefully this makes sense sadly i still reading webpack to try be able to help but the logic and negotiations i think is pretty clear,NONE

1196414036,question,suggestion query regarding removal of cryptojs dependency,thanks for the brilliant work on this library i should preface this by saying im not experienced with jsts or security generally and im a pm not a developer so apologies if these thoughts are a bit of a confused brain dump i have had a go at removing the cryptojs dependency from this library fork here what i found was that all cryptojs dependencies are called from cryptoutilsts i replaced the existing methods with the code here to use native browser methods whether these are specification compliant i dont know its unlikely but ill cross that bridge later the main challenge i found was that the native cryptosubtledigest method returns a promise unlike the cryptojs method sha256 which returns a string because my understanding of async is poor the easiest way i could find to work around this was to add async build methods to the signinrequest and signinstate classes i then need to call these build methods when constructing these classes elsewhere this is rather horrible but it does seem to work i havent updated unit tests in the proof of concept updates ive made because i think my foundation here is poor so my question is ultimately this at some point in future i expect there will be a desire to remove the cryptojs dependency altogether since native browser methods could feasibly be used thus reducing bundle size i appreciate this wont happen soon because youll likely want to maintain backward compatibility for a while longer yet however in the meantime would you be willing to consider returning a promise from the method instead of a string because this might make the eventual transition easier whenif that happens at some point in the future,NONE

1102797910,question,support request a few questions during the excellent experience,describe your problem first of all i would like to thank you for developing such a wonderful extension and maintaining it constantly in my use of this extension i have several questions general 1 i am currently using the api and hub to get the status of all my accessories and have homebridge running on a synology nas docker if i want to use ble instead of api does that mean i need to buy an bluetooth adapter for the nas 2 is it possible in the future to get the status of all accessories via hub like what is done in the switchbot app considering the configuration complexity of ble and the limitation of api update interval about contact sensor 3 on the switchbot app i can get an exit status and configure the scenes accordingly which is very useful and is an important node for me to configure my smart home but now i want to use homebridge to do this but i cant find a similar status what i can think of is to add a home occupied status to the contact sensor about motion sensor 4 i have the motion sensor linked to a bot im currently setting up scenes in the switchbot app to do this and the execution delay is around 2 seconds but now i want to do the same thing via homebridge but i find that updating the status of the motion sensor via the api usually takes half a minute to a minute which is too long is there a way to get the status of the motion sensor in about a second and reflect it on homebridge about bot 5 if i let some bots execute commands at the same time it tends to take a long time this is certainly not a problem with your extension i get the same result with alexa im just curious if this can be improved in the future config for homebridgeswitchbot shell bridge name homebridge username port 53725 pin 03145154 accessories platforms name config port 8581 platform config name switchbot credentials opentoken notice keep your token a secret options devices deviceid hidedevice false configdevicetype bot bot mode switch devicetype switch deviceid hidedevice false configdevicetype bot bot mode switch devicetype switch deviceid hidedevice false configdevicetype bot bot mode switch devicetype switch deviceid hidedevice false configdevicetype bot bot mode switch devicetype switch deviceid hidedevice false configdevicetype bot bot mode switch devicetype switch deviceid configdevicetype contact sensor deviceid configdevicetype contact sensor deviceid configdevicetype motion sensor refreshrate 35 pushrate 1 platform switchbot name nest refreshtoken fandurationminutes 30 options platform nest screenshots no response device model synology ds920 nodejs version v16131 npm version v812 homebridge version v139 homebridge switchbot plugin version v170 homebridge config ui x plugin version v4415 operating system docker,NONE

1362333687,question,average ble indicate response time 34001020msec more than notification30msec,board esp32 devboard device description standard esp32 development board hardware configuration using arduino ble nothing else required version v202 ide name arduinoide and platformio operating system windows 81 flash frequency 240mhz psram enabled no upload speed 921600 description the time taken for receiving an indication to a write to ble characteristic is so so much longer than a notify on notify taking 30milli seconds as opposed to 1020milli seconds for indication while i understand indicate requires acknowledgment and hence a little longer than notification it seams indication is taking far too long and causing issue in our project in the attached sketch i have tried to simplify the code as much as i can it consists of two separate code for server on one board and a client on another board the client code basically starts a connection to a server then after registering for notification writes to a ble characteristic and take a time stamp then waits 2500milli second before it repeats the test while waiting if a notification or indication when the server notifies or indicate to the client the notifycallback on the client prints the details and restart the time stamp after printing the return time on the server as soon as a callback onwrite to either notification or indication is called the code in the callback increments a local value and either notifies or indicates back to the client depending i am not sure if extra code is required for indication on both client and server hence it is not there in both client and server code you can select by uncommenting either notificationon or indicationon link to source code and log files sketch cpp based on neil

1238770113,question,why do sleeping futexbased spinlocks wake and spin again periodically,im trying to understand this code spinlock uses futexes for the slow path on linux the thread calling futexwait apparently sets a random timeout on the wait when either the futex is woken or the timeout expires the thread will wake up and try to take the lock again but afaict the thread that holds the lock will reliably call futexwake when releasing it so it seems like there is no reason for the waiting thread to set a timeout it will always get an explicit wake if the lock is available if it wakes from the timeout it will presumably always find the lock is still held in which case it will spinloop burning cpu and then if its still locked go back to sleep this code appears to be ancient the same code can be found in gperftools where it appears to date back to at least 2009 before that the code didnt use futex at all and was just a sleep loop is this timeout behavior vestigial and possibly no longer useful i came across this behavior while trying to debug a problem we see in production with tcmalloc occasionally a server gets locked up with 1000 threads all waiting on the global freelists spinlock it looks like this is not a deadlock situation but instead a live lock we suspect the spinlock behavior means that when a very large number of threads is waiting on the same spinlock the cpu gets saturated with threads running spinloop while the thread that actually holds the lock struggles to make progress were going to try ripping out all the spinning code and see if that improves anything but i also want to understand if theres some rationale behind the approach here,NONE

983307540,question,decide how to structure 32x32 images,in talking with ryan it seems that when we write a 32x32 image to a data file its actually 4 16x16 images written one after the other and these images have different orientations corresponding to the orientations of the quabos in the module doing things this way may add complexity to data analysis eg figuring out which pixels are adjacent or where each one is on the sky alternatively we could shuffle data in the data recorder so that the 32x32 image is stored in its natural order this would use some cpu time in the data recorder but it might be negligible i could check this,COLLABORATOR

387872720,question,inheritance principle clarify the procedure of which files would be considered,it might be just me but from current wording it is not 100 clear if it is only run and rec are of special treatment to be generalized over or any other possible keyvalue pair acq etc ie for a file subses func would taskjson at the top level be considered disregarding any possibly present optional key like acq ce etc what about anatomy eg for a file subses anat would json be considered regardless any of the possible acq ce etc present in the target subjectsession specific file to make it totally clear it might be worth to formulate explicitly a generic rule to generate higher level filename considered for inheritance for any given leaf file might be already as implemented in pybids didnt check yet strip sub prefix while providing generalization across subjects remove ses while providing generalization across sessions remove any key if generalizing across various types of acquisition strip possibly present leading if left only with the suffix such as json in anat example what do you think or it is just me and current wording is sufficient i would be ok with that fwiw

only a single applicable file at any given level which is demonstrated in example 1 two json files at same level that are applicable for nifti file violating the constraint that no more than one file may be defined at a given level of the directory structure wording around soon to be tuned up a bit in a i do not see a clear definition of such constraint in the actual text describing inheritance principle while working on fixing auto aggregation of common fields into the top level files to be inherited within heudiconv i placed myself into a corner with an example of having eg and per subject should be ok and then trying to aggregate over them while retaining also acq if defined then i would end up with tasktask1boldjson at the top level is this legit should then acqxbold leaf files inherit also from tasktask1boldjson it shouldnt be so i guess and it is not just a matter of having that constraint no more than one file may be defined at a given level of the directory structure because i could potentially place the acqx in persubject directory thus avoiding it it is a matter of clear definition on how we expand the common filename to match any leaf one if it is a matter of the fact that we could expand into a leaf file with arbitrary additional keyvalue pairs then the situation above could be ok so that could extend or overwrite but not delete fields defined in tasktask1boldjson,COLLABORATOR

1074490692,question,user vs app token for trusted client,i have a question regarding the reason why youd want to choose between a user token a token that was granted to the client by the user vs an app token a token normally obtained through clientcredentials and which doesnt have a user identity associated in the normal usecase where the client is untrusted and if i understand correctly one reason you use a user token is to be able to allow the client to have access to whatever data the resource server serves about that user but to also control which user identity the context is talking about thus the token being signed the client cant change which users data will be returned which sounds fine in the context of an untrusted client but what about the scenarios where the client is trusted its part of the identityserver landscape it might even use ropc even thought yeah its not generally recommended in the case of a trusted client whats the difference between using a user token vs using an apptoken and having the userid just part of the normal request and not part of the token in theory the trusted client could change the userid to fish for another userid but you trust it not to is it worth the headache of using a user token in that scenario over an app token and just using the userid as a public parameter of the api interface thanks and im really curious about the answer edit one thing that might be worth mentioning is that im only asking about access tokens not identity tokens though that should be faily obvious now that im writing this anyway ill leave the remark here just to make sure,NONE

1341975922,question,simpleinjector integration with nservicebus,hi i have a question regarding nservicebus and simpleinjector and wondering if you could assist me ive been using simpleinjector for quite some time now for my aspnet core rest apis azure webjobs and some console background workers with good success im currently in the process now to add new functionality to our platform that uses nservicebus endpoints after some investigation and googleing i havent been able to find concrete information on how to integrate the simpleinjector di container with the nservicebus endpoints the nservicebus endpoints are implemented on top of the net generic host similar to this the integrates with the microsoft generic host and automatically uses the hosts managed dependency injection container thats then either the native di container or a 3rd party container that overrides the on the generic host as i understand simpleinjector does not replace the net built in container is there then a way for me to use simpleinjector as my preferred di container to register my application dependencies with my nservicebus endpoints that i build on top of the microsoft generic host with version 7 of nservicebus they support overriding the container by invoking a method on the called i think i saw a comment from you on some issue on github that you adviced people not to use this package since its neither an official nservicebus nor simpleinjector package however the usecontainer will be removed from version 8 that is now in prerelease mode so i dont want to spend time trying to figure out how to solve this with the usecontainer method here are the di upgrade guides going from version 7 to 8 will i need to create my own implementation of this iconfigurecomponents abstraction and some comment where you are replying to a nsb dev regarding this topic so to wrap up how could i use nservicebus along side simpleinjector with the changes they propose in version8 i hope this is clear enough,NONE

1223193954,question,question how to correctly cite cff repositories,dear maintainers first of all thank you for your work i am new to this standard and would like to apply it to my own repositories after working through your guideline for the latest version 120 i am unsure how to correctly cite your repositories in order to honour your authorship of this standard appropriately the questions can be summarised as follows explanations for them are provided below 1 x how to basically cite another repository using the cff standard 2 x which repositories should be cited 3 x can citation files be hard coded in templates or redistributed in any way how to basically cite another repository using the cff standard according to the guideline you provide in this repository i understand that the meta data of the citationcff from the repository to be cited source repository should be added to the references section in ones own repository target repository the question is about the amount of meta data which should be included one possibility the maximal approach might be to just coping all lines except the cffversion message and references section from the source repository and pasting them in the citationcff of the target repository that way literally any information of the source repository will be listed in the references section of the target repository but since github automatically parses such citationcff configuration files using your rubycff library and presents the parsing results in a cite this repository text box on the concerning projects welcome page i am unsure whether these meta data would suffice as well after being converted from the resulting bibtex entry back to a cff these meta data are based on the preferredcitation so basically they refer to the source repository as well i would like to name this approach minimal furthermore there is also a somehow extended approach of citing other repositories for instance i like preparing repository manuals for my repositories these manuals are compiled from the contained readme changelog and license files and hence contain the most important information about the concerning project since i use pandoc therefore the manual is compiled using latex internally such that i could attach a bibliography as well or at least copy and paste the apa citation string to the repositorys readme using this approach in addition to one of the others from above the source repository would be definitely cited in the target repository my question is which combination of these three approaches is the recommended one in order to cite another repository i myself would prefer the extended maximal approach adding all meta data from the source repository in the target repositorys references section and citing githubs parsing results with both the apa and bibtex entries in the corresponding repository manual furthermore how to cite a repository which does not even contain a citationcff or whose citation file does not meet the cff 120 standard what is the best practice therefore which repositories should be cited since i worked through the guideline of this repository i would like to definitely cite it in every of my citationcffs just for completeness in addition i used your cffconvert in order to verify the syntactic correctness of the resulting citation file so i would guess that i rather should cite its repository as well but what about the rubycff library which is applied by github automatically i am sure that it would not be fault to cite it anyway but if a software is applied on one of my repositories without being invoked actively by me do i need to cite it or can i just assume it a standard which does not need to be cited in general i assume that any submodule which has an appropriate citationcff should be cited as well as any software and or paper which had a major impact on the development but when should i stop citing software do i need to cite even the ide i used for development or even the operating system what about software i did not invoke myself such as the rubycff example from above can citation files be hard coded in templates or redistributed in any way since i typically use the gpl 20 license for my repositories i created a repository for source file templates these always contain the default gpl 20 license text as well as a sane minimal functionality such that i can rely on those templates in order to have working source files which only need to fill with the intended functionality i started to create a template for my personal citationcff as well but it turned out to do not meet the cff standard i oriented on the corresponding section in the github manual which well just contains an absolutely minimum of information about the cff standard not including the ability to name references i would like to fix it but i need to know whether i am allowed to hard code your repositories citation meta data in a gpl 20 template in the references section the question here is merely if a certain citation file does not contain the license text of the license which the concerning repository belongs to is it still bound to the repositorys license since i would fix the template after working through your guideline in this repository i would like to cite it appropriately in the template due to this repository being licensed ccby40 this should be no problem in the sense of license compatibility but the issue becomes difficult when thinking about cffconvert which i would like to use in order to verify the correctness of the resulting template since it has an apache 20 license which i first would need to check for compatibility with my preferred license gpl 20 which the template belongs to the interesting point is the license text your citation files do not contain the minimal license text of their respective licenses but my template does hence the template is clearly licensed gpl 20 but one could wonder whether your citation files are also distributed under their respective repositories licenses conclusion i know these might be a bit complicated strange and to some point also pathological questions i would appreciate your help to find answers for them and to discuss the possible options with you in order to also help the people with the same questions to find solutions to similar questions furthermore the results of the discussion might be used to enhance the current version of the guideline for future versions of the cff standard,NONE

1202313577,question,how to create derived states,first of all congratulations for this great library i was trying to create a state that is derived from other states i could create using useref usestate from react or usememo ive created one codesandbox with one example of what im trying to do basically the idea is to have one state to hold one large list of something one state to hold one object with filters that will apply one state to hold one object with the definition of the sorting that will be applied with these 3 base states id like to create one hook that depends on the large list and the filter state and returns the filtered list one hook that depends on the last one filtered list and the sorter definition and returns the filtered list sortered what im looking for is a way to do this the best way possible so that the sorting and the filtering only happens when needed because the list is large and the filtering and sorting logic can be quite complex rerenderes happens only when needed state updates propagates to the respective components updates to the filter sorter or the original list data ability to use async state for the list data thank you,NONE

1267808632,question,propagation pattern,hi i am slightly confused about the section on propagation pattern and want to bring up several points in the stepbystep mode for a nonzero input you have nonzero states in the neurons at the last layer in other words the spike propagation of the input isnt implemented in discrete time steps in the layerbylayer mode the implementation is similar to neuromorphic chips or most of the other snn frameworks where spike propagation is in discrete time steps meaning that spikes that are caused by a nonzero input need to propagate through the network in order to have nonzero states in the next layers more concretely if we were to have a 10layer architecture and only present input to the network at t0 we would start seeing neuronal activity at the 10th layer only at t10 singlestep n c w h input needs to be used for the stepbystep mode whereas the multistep t n c w h input needs to be used for the layerbylayer mode i hope my understanding is so far correct i would strongly argue that the two cases stepbystep and layerbylayer dont result in the same neuronal states in the last layer of the network at t10 in the layerbylayer case the input needs to sequentially pass through the network resulting in a higher amount of potential leakage possibly not reaching the threshold and not spiking therefore there might not be neuronal activity in the last layer at all assuming we are using a lif neuron but this wouldnt be the case in a stepbystep mode the same input would already result in a nonzero state in the last layer at t0 if my understanding is so far correct then could there be a mistake in the computational graph of the layerbylayer case the attached drawing is what i wouldve expected img width1039 src thanks a lot for this great work and i really appreciate the quick and helpful responses,NONE

1114412306,question,substring apis are matched too agressively using the default config,i have a helm config which contains deprecated instances of both apiversion kind clusterrole and apiversion kind clusterrolebinding edit the default mapping contains apiversion clusterrole which matchesreplaces both of the above types and when the plugin checks for clusterrolebinding it doesnt find any because they have already been replaced by the previous match so i was confused when running a dryrun and mapkubeapis was only finding clusterrole and not clusterrolebinding digging into the code i found the reason for this is because clusterrole is a substring of clusterrolebinding and all instances of clusterrolebinding had been replaced before it was checked in this case this is only an issue of cli output and the resulting helm manifest ends up the same either way however i can see a situation where this could cause a problem where you want to upgrade one kind but not the other some possible fixes would be to 1 change the order of matches in the default config so that longer kinds come first 2 add newline characters at the end of all the map strings in the mapping config 3 use a regex instead of stringsreplace which matches the strings more strictly with maybe any whitespace at the end,NONE

1117389371,question,style remove backend identifier from frontendcompile signature,the longterm goal is to decouple completely the front end arithmetic circuit to constraint system and back end from constraint system to proof and verification right now there are a lot of share types and variables which prevent doing that cleanly and requires quite a lot of refactoring however as a first step we should at least remove the reference to the backend in eccid zkpid backendid circuit circuit opts compileoption as there is a bit more to it right now we support compiling to r1cs and sparser1cs and they are correspondingly used as inputs to the groth16 and plonk proving systems however there are other possible backends which could take the corresponding constraint systems as inputs which we may implement in the future another aspect to consider is that we currently support setting a custom builder as compile option however this shouldnt be the default way to set the output constraint system as this requires setting a compile option which is in contradiction with the term option so before we start changing anything i would ask opinions on how the interface should look 1 create a new package simplify and for now define only the ids of different constraints systems there type id uint8 const unknown id iota r1cs sparser1cs then define compile as eccid csid constraintsystemid circuit circuit opts compileoption when doing this i wouldnt yet move anything else related to cs to the new package as it would be quite large refactoring 2 use generics create a new package as previously but also define constraint csbuilder and then define compile as compilecs csbuildercurveid eccid circuit circuit opts compileoption at first step i wouldnt change the output signature but at some point we could also make the returned cs to be parametrized by csbuilder constraint this allows to have a typesafe way to call the particular backends 3 remove the backend identifier from the arguments and require that the builder is set as a compile option eccid circuit circuit opts compileoption 4 remove the withbuilder compile option and make it mandatory eccid builder newbuilder circuit circuit opts compileoption 5 something else i think it may be just to early for 1 and 2 for 1 it makes sense to do with the rest of decoupling for 2 we need to wait until the generics really mature and after that we need to do a massive refactoring third one is also ugly as compilation should be possible without setting any options i think the fourth option makes sense but it puts a pressure on the developer who needs to know what back end takes which type of constraint system as input to simplify the user experience a bit we should have a defaultbuilder method in the back end packages which return something but this still keeps some kind of coupling,CONTRIBUTOR

1166710723,question,midi rendering of cue notes,related to pr and somewhat related to issue another possibility is to use notevel to control playback of cue notes instead of or in addition to a verovio option for midi rendering of cue notes if someone does not want cue notes to sound then they can add notevel0 when vel is set to zero the note should not be exported to midi at all ie do not output one or two noteoffs for the note if someone wants the midi export to include the cue notes but they do not want to hear them then notevel1 could be used again it is better if cue notes are sounding as a default behavior in the meitomidi exporter in particular because there is no clear encoding method yet for cue versus small notes see related to this probably notevel is not implemented yet in the meitomidi converter it should be very easy if not and it would also be useful for future enhancement of dyanmics rendering in the midi output ie have the dynamics inserted into the midi export,CONTRIBUTOR

777655693,question,bug jsonableencoder function not working as expected with different type of variables,first check x i added a very descriptive title to this issue x i used the github search to find a similar issue and didnt find it x i searched the fastapi documentation with the integrated search x i already searched in google how to x in fastapi and didnt find any information x i already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didnt find an answer x i already checked if it is not related to fastapi but to pydantic x i already checked if it is not related to fastapi but to swagger ui x i already checked if it is not related to fastapi but to redoc x after submitting this i commit to one of read open issues with questions until i find 2 issues where i can help someone and add a comment to help there i already hit the watch button in this repository to receive notifications and i commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future implement a pull request for a confirmed bug im asking all this because answering questions and solving problems in github issues consumes a lot of time i end up not being able to add new features fix bugs review pull requests etc as fast as i wish because i have to spend too much time handling issues all that on top of all the incredible help provided by a bunch of community members that give a lot of their time to come here and help others thats a lot of work they are doing but if more fastapi users came to help others like them just a little bit more it would be much less effort for them and you and me example heres a selfcontained minimal reproducible example with my use case example 1 basemodel python import pytest from attr import dataclass from fastapiencoders import jsonableencoder from pydanticmain import basemodel class mybasemodelbasemodel foo int bar int obj include exclude expected mybasemodelfoo1 bar2 none none foo 1 bar 2 passed mybasemodelfoo1 bar2 passed mybasemodelfoo1 bar2

mymodelfoo1 bar2 failed mymodelfoo1 bar2 foo foo 1 failed mymodelfoo1 bar2 foo failed mymodelfoo1 bar2 foo none foo 1 failed mymodelfoo1 bar2 none foo bar 2 failed def include exclude expected assert jsonableencoderobj includeinclude excludeexclude expected description i was trying to understand how the include and exclude parameters worked i looked in the documentation here and the the test suite here latest commit of this file in master branch and i did not find anything related to include and exclude in both places i did see that these 2 parameters came from pydantic from the dict function and it is being used in the calculatekeys method the first thing i did was to check the jsonableencoder using a basemodel object which uses the dict function from pydantic example 1 so i created a set of test with a basemodel instance all those tests are passing then i created the same tests with a python dictionary example 2 and a python object example 3 i expect that the same tests with a different type of variable would work the same in the case of example 3 it is failing the most because it is missing the include and exclude parameters at the end of the function here environment os linux python 385 fastapi version 0630 to know the fastapi version use bash python c import fastapi printfastapiversion python version to know the python version use bash python version additional context to reproduce the example snippets you will also need pytest installed 621 in my case i am happy to help by creating a pr for this bug once it is confirmed all examples together python import

141100964,question,figure out how to handle the curriculum workshop page,the proposed curriculum workshop page looks like this image there is a tabbed navigation near the top of the page the displays different content depending on which tab is selected image the issues this entire page is too large to be and doesnt need to be a template it will never really get duplicated just edited this page is too large as one chunk to be an editable page within the cms the tabbed navigation will make the editing experience complicated however the workshop page should be a template as it will be used to contain past workshops which will be linked from the schedule page a potential solution one solution is to create a system where we can pull in separate editable cms pages into a larger non editable page so the wrapper page would contain the page title and the tabbed navigation and would take two parameters the url or internal reference to the next workshop page the workshop page will be editable and a considered a template within the cms as well need to make multiples the url or internal reference to the schedule page the schedule page will be editable within the cms but not a template concerns the main concern is the ux of editing these pages and changing the reference to the current workshop page which will be different every week how do we indicate to the user which parts of a page are editable and take them to the right place is there a concept like this in calypso from my own wordpress use you get an edit link at the top if you have editing rights when you click it you edit the entire page youre seeing this wont be possible with the proposed solution can we offer the user a way to choose which page they want to edit the workshop or the schedule page maybe we can detect which section of the page were looking at and take them to the right place curious to hear your thoughts vazquez gvn mmmavis,NONE

1021999304,question,roadmap for mkdocstringspytkdocs in regard to extensions,hi pawamoy thanks a lot for creating mkdocstrings and pytkdocs its great to see the rise of autodocumentation with mkdocs too background ive been mainly using sphinx in the past but i start to see a great benefit in using mkdocs and your packages because of simplicity and ease of development sphinx code base is huge and has a lots of complexity ive recently created the autodocpydantic sphinx extension to allow proper automated documentation for pydantic modelssettings im thinking about adding support for mkdocstrings too in fact i would really like to problem description however ive come across some issues while experimenting with pytkdocs in regard to pydantic models which are currently a stopper for me default values for class attributes aka fields are not fetched root validators are not picked up standard doc strings for fields are not collected currently the field description is used instead i can see two possible approaches to tackle these points 1 adjust pytkdocs code base to support custom pydantic requirements 2 allow extensions to handle introspection for custom classes much like sphinxextautodoc offers the former approach works on short term as it already partially does for pydantic however i guess its not the best solution on long term because all logic about custom types is entangled in pytkdocs core there are more use cases other than pydantic which would require the same treatment and ultimately they would all need to go in pytkdocss core the latter approach seems much more flexible because it would allow external developers to extend pytkdocs core to support custom types hence pytkdocs remains lean and supports the python defaults only while offering an interface to register custom collectors this is currently possible with sphinxextautodoc which is really great i would love to see the same with pytkdocs there might be a third approach to completely bypass pytkdocs but this would mean duplicating lots of functionality i dont consider this viable question i scanned through some of the existing issues which also touch this topic im interested to know where youre currently heading and what your roadmap looks like thanks,NONE

1290533351,question,question about logs and how to best configure w this buildpack,hello i had a general question about configuration and the state of heroku datadog and logs i did search through old issues here and found some conflicting andor outdated info it seems the recommended way to get logs going from heroku to datadog is to use a heroku log drain this sends the heroku level logs and will also send app logs that are routed to stdout via the drain this works and is what ive setup for our app currently however there is one significant problem all logs collected via that drain have the same source heroku and the same service name and same host which are specified via the heroku drain command this means we lose a ton of visibility and traceability because all the logs basically come in from one coarse grained thing and the router level logs get mixed up with the app level logs it is possible to filter down a bit thru clever searching and i know we could do our own attribute remapping but that seems overly complicated and brittle is there a better solution here im missing should we just route logs to the heroku file system and use the dd buildpack agent to send app level logs and hope transient dynos dont cause a ton of problems with that i feel like i may be missing something but this default setup is severely lacking compared to a more traditional dd logging setup,NONE

1340932541,question,query question regarding pagination with database throttling,hi i have a doubt regarding belows sentence which is mentioned in this doc if you execute the same query multiple times the number of pages might not be constant for example if a query is throttled there may be fewer available results per page which means the query will have additional pages in some cases it is also possible that your query may return an empty page of results how can i simulate this throttling scenario that mention in above sentence i tried to raise the 429 and from my application i can see that after reach the max retry an exception will throw also as long as i increase my max retry attempt to higher number and all my requests will pass so it is either throw error or retry success and i never see a case that only return partial of the data why i am worry about this sentence that is because in our use case we will store all the continuation token of each page for the same query to cosmos we expecting with the same token and same query we should get the same sizecount of data and same order ps lets assume it will not have any new data insert for this query then later some workers will pick up a token in parallel to perform some business logic and continue the downstream we want to make sure that the token and the count of the records that we store for each page should always the same for the workers same token should get the same sets of records for a page with my test since i set the retry attempt to large number so even 429 happen i eventually able to insert all the token to cosmos and everytime it has the same set of records and token for each page samething for the workers when the 429 happen the workers are able to retrieve the correct set of data after retry so i am not seeing this cases if a query is throttled there may be fewer available results per page if the sentence mentioned in the doc is true then i am assuming below cases might happen actually we dont want to see them happen first there is no throttling happen during the time we store all those token to cosmos table looks like this total records should be 220 page token size notes 0 t0 100 1 t1 20 end of one partition 2 null 100 no more page later when multiple workers start picking up the token and throttling happen will any workers get less size of data for example maybe worker 0 picked up token t1 but it only retrieved 8 records you see the issue here right at the end the workers only processed 208 records out of 220 missed 12 second throttling happen during the time we store the token and also happen when the workers start working total records should be 220 page token size notes 0 t0 88 missed 12 1 t1 10 missed 10 2 t2 12 the missing 12 comes to this page 3 t3 10 the missing 10 comes to this page 4 null 100 no more page with this case will the worker again get less records for a particular token for example maybe worker 0 picked up token t1 but it only retrieved 8 records i can only simulate the 429 throttling in my end not sure what other throttling scenario i can simulate to achieve the case that mention in the doc,NONE

1206002506,question,question consider only shenyubootstrap run mode,question i ran shenyuadmin and shenyubootstrap through dockercompose on raspberry pi arm64 without configuring any plugins selectors rules and found that each of these two services takes up about 1 gb and my raspberry pi has only 4 gb of memory in total i personally think that shenyuadmin is just a gui interface for configuration when the project is mature and stable all plugins selectors the rule configuration has been solidified and will not change in this scenario shenyuadmin should provide a method to export all plugins selectors and rule configuration data to static files such as json format configuration data files and then shenyubootstrap loads this static configuration data file into the memory at this time it is equivalent to only running shenyubootstrap and it is no longer necessary to run the shenyuadmin service which can reduce and optimize the memory usage of the server,NONE

1295055785,question,qst,redquestionmark questions help details if transformers4rec is used at training time offline does this necessitate that the model must do real time inference when deployed to put the question a bit more concretely say i train a transformer on a dataset that consists of sequences of user item clickssame session to do next item prediction at deployment is it necessary to run inference on the trained transformer the alternative computationally cheaper would be to utilize the trained transformer to precompute item embeddings specifically context vectors for every item id at inference time simply run ann given the current item’s embedding the way these item embeddings would be generated would be passing in 1id sequences to the transformer and getting the context vector is this a reasonable idea what would be an alternative if one wanted to use transformers offline to train on sequences but precompute embeddings for each item so that online inference is cheap i’m a bit hesitant to convince myself of the second approach because embeddings that come from a transformer are by nature context dependent and the whole premise of using the transformer was so that the current items context vector could attend to the previously observed items would the context vectors resulting from 1element sequences be any more powerful than if one simply ran cbow word2vec on clicked item sequences,NONE

1146528675,question,remove element wise operations of exp and gamma to prevent confusion,there is a standard meaning for the gamma function applied to a square matrix see which is not the gamma function applied componentwise like the current behavior of gammam in mathjs also the componentwise application already has another very short expression namely mapm gamma to avoid potential confusion should the current matrix interpretation of gammam as componentwise application be eliminated requiring the use of mapm gamma that way no one would accidentally call gamma on a square matrix thinking they were getting the usual matrix gamma function and if anyone ever chose to implement the usual matrix gamma it could either be overloaded onto the gamma symbol or called gammam by analogy with expm in fact the analogy with exp is very strong the usual mathematical meaning of exp of a square matrix is not componentwise exponentiation but rather the matrix exponential clearly a specific decision was made to call that operation expm in mathjs and i am not suggesting that decision be revisited but i would suggest that the componentwise meaning of expm be disabled and the documentation of exp be revised to point to expm for the matrix exponential and mapm exp for componentwise exponentiation again the motivation here is to avoid the potential confusion of someone calling expm thinking they were getting expmm failing that id suggest amplifying the documentation of exp to make it more prominent that expm is not the matrix exponential in any case perhaps it would be good to make a decision at least on whether gamma should continue to apply componentwise to matrices before acting on pr 2416 which is the proximate cause of my looking into the semantics of gamma and raising this issue,COLLABORATOR

906487799,question,very confused about the method semantics,first of all i want to say that im very thankful that you open sourced this project it really helped me refactor many lines of code and its a very valuable tool to have many have mentioned the lack of documentation or how spread it is myself included however the lack of documentation may be not as problematic if you can build some intuition around how to use the library and its methods however i find some behaviors very counterintuitive and very hard to grasp which coupled with the lack of documentation leads to a very frustrating and very unperformant experience i will list the main confusing points for me and what i am guessing from my experience using the library if you can clarify those points i think they may be a very nice thing to add to the docs the first thing i find very confusing are the arraylike methods they are similar enough to the usual ones to feel familiar but have some subtle differences that make predicting the outcome hard find find according to the method description it returns a new collection containing the nodes that match the filter one may expect that this collection only contains such nodes however if you do tosource on the resulting collection you get the entire sourcecode my expectation was to get just the source of the filtered nodes so for this i was expecting this import usestate from react but instead got import usestate from react const stuff stuff export default stuff seems that the only way to extract nodes is by calling paths on the resulting collection like pathsmapx jxtosource this seems to work but its a bit weird to go back and forth between unwrapping nodes and wrapping them again to then convert them correct me if im wrong this made me think that i was not getting a new collection but instead the same collection with a pointer pointing to the filtered nodes with this assumption i thought that i can point up and down the hierarchy but not trying to access parent on the resulting collection leads to undefined it will be very nice to build pipelines if you can traverse up and down the tree so you filter do some modifications then go back to the root and do other modifications etc root mapdostuff toroot find mapdootherstuff tosource instead you have to do a selection do modifications on it and then you have to go back to the root node and do other modifications root mapdostuff root find mapdootherstuff tosource this leads me to the next confusing thing when to expect mutations to the collection and when not mutability it is very confusing to me that being used to other map filter and reduce methods that some collection methods perform side effects on the original collection given the previous example this is what i expected to have to do const newroot root mapdostuff newroot find mapdootherstuff tosource however that is not needed and it is because any action you do on any node mutates the entire tree no matter how many times you find filter map and move nodes around hor how far you are from the root tree any mutation to any nested node will have an impact on the generated output source this is because as i said previously calls to this methods does not give you a new collection but the same original one but narrowed no real independence this makes me ask how can i take an slice of a collection i can obviously do jsource again and apply all the same finds filters and transformations but it feels a bit wasteful to do the same operations when i need the same collection for different things some examples imagine i want to find certain pattern and duplicate it with slight variations so i can not just do a replace i need to find copy several modify several and append collect some patterns move them to a new file and substitute them by imports on the current file different styles for similar operations finally doesnt seem to be a completely declarative way of doing all operations there is a mix between completely declarative way of doing things and more manual ways for similar operations for example imported name nametoremove is purely declarative and gives you a smaller collection than the one you have while on the other hand find path pathnodeimportedname something requires to go deep on the inner node structure and do some logic which one should i use which one is more preformant should i just mutate existing nodes or create new nodes using the data of previously existing ones this always leaves me guessing the best way of doing certain tasks sorry for the wall of text you dont have to answer everything but i will be very grateful if you answer at least some regards,NONE

1258386278,question,differing isort behavior in local vs remote superlinter runs and vs cmd line isort,last week i started running into an issue where my command line run of isort started differing from my local superlinter run of isort i have a script i use to run superlinter which first runs things like black standard and isort so that certain issues are automatically fixed before it does a local run of superlinter i had to comment out my run of isort from the script because while it is still changing import order in the same way consistent with previously superlinted commits superlinter issues isort errors saying it wants the imports sorted differently eg it wants to put from django level imports below our local from datarepo package imports but when i run isort on the command line even if i explicitly supply the isortcfg file it changes the import order in a way that causes superlinters run of isort to complain i checked and our isortcfg file has not changed in 15 months i also have the latest stable version of isort installed ie i tried pip install isort and it said im already on the latest version heres an example i made manual edits to the following files in my latest commit to make superlinters isort not complain but when i run isort on the command line in any of these 3 ways it complains about those files imports isort checkonly settings error imports are

1229114040,question,unexpected behavior with hillessteele scan,im not sure if this is a bug of some kind or just user of how taichi is supposed to work but i was surprised by the behavior in the code example below this snippet implements a simple hillessteele scan and uses it to attempt get the cumulative sum of a 100000 element field filled with 1s the output is fine up until the 30720th entry in the array after which the entries are incorrect and nonderministic for example the last element of the output array should of course be 100000 but ive been seeing values from 210000 to 290000 ish the number 30720 looked suspicious to me and indeed its 161920 the latter of which is the number of cuda cores available in my nvidia rtx 2060 i dont really know what is going wrong my best guess is that it seems to be some kind of race situation in particular because of the appearance of that magic number 30720 maybe the hardware is saturated and data race but im not really sure why there would be a race condition ive certainly run parallel for loops over fields with many more elements than this without any issues this scan implementation is inspired by the parallelsort function in and i have noticed that that function includes a sync call ive tried putting sync in a many different places with no change in the values im seeing but i wonder if i need to use sync somehow or some other lowlevel runtime method like that finally in case it might be helpful for writing docs that guide other users away from whatever i am misunderstanding ill add a bit of background about why i found this behavior surprising and i guess relatedly why i was surprised that a sync function even exists and was surprised it would be needed in parallelsort in my mental model of taichi and based on the examples ive looked at i have been assuming that from the perspective of the python code calling the kernels kernel invocations are inherently serial and synchronous that is if you have python code like python tikernel1 tikernel2 tikernel3 then all of the gpu work associated with tikernel1 will finish before any of tikernel2s work starts and all of tikernel2s work will finish before tikernel3 starts and it should not be possible to have data races between these kernels the existence of the sync function seem like a hint to me my mental model is not correct because it seems like it would not be needed if all kernel invocations were serial and synchronous so i guess perhaps this is an area of the docs that might benefit from some clarification when are kernels launched asyncparallel vs syncserial and how is this controlled when can kernel invocations result in race conditions between subsequent invocations how can these race conditions be prevented what does the sync function do and when is it needed thanks as always for the great work on taichi im always learning something fun when i work with it and im sure i will learn a lot from whatever im misunderstanding in this example my nonworking scan code python import taichi as ti import numpy as np tiinitarchtigpu tikernel def fillintfield titemplate x int for i in field fieldi x def preparehsscaninfield outfield tifunc tikernel def scanstagelast titemplate step int for i in last outfieldi lasti if i step else tifunclasti step lasti def scan step 1 while step n last infield if step 1 else outfield scanstagelast step step step 2 return scan tifunc def tisuma b return a b n int100000 fieldin tifieldtiint32 shapen fillintfieldin 1 fieldout tifieldtiint32 shapen scan1 outfieldfieldout tifunctisum scan1 fieldoutnp fieldouttonumpy last value in the array should be 100000 nondeterministic output from 220000 to 280000 ish printfieldoutn 1 first element of the arrays that doesnt match always 30720 on my machine which is 192016 rtx2060 has 1920 cuda cores nparange1 n 1 example output from the above including version and system info taichi version 101 llvm 1000 commit 1c3619d9 linux python 397 taichi starting on archcuda 290112 30720,NONE

1018170428,question,question best way to learn from arbitraryplaced sequences,in the end what im aiming at is sortof mimicking how convolutions work in a neural network but i dont know if this is possible at all in lightgbm and if so what is the best way to do it suppose there is an input feature which consists of sequence of trigram characters example 1 ams mst ste ter erd rda dam example 2 new ewy wyo yor ork i would like the model to learn that the sequence mst ste ter in that order is indicative of the class amsterdam but the place at which this sequence is located should not be a hard condition the issue im struggling with is that if i simply encode each trigram as a separate categorical feature then the model would learn that if trigram1 ams trigram2 mst trigram3 ste then this is indicative of amsterdam but then this information wouldnt generalize if the trigrams are offset by one or more characters eg trigram4 ams trigram5 mst trigram6 ste however i would still like the model to keep some degree of preference in the position of appearance of a sequence for instance the above sequence would be more indicative or amsterdam if its in the beginning of the string rather than at the end but still able to generalise flexible positions this is typically a good use case for convolutions in a neural network is it possible to reproduce this with lightgbm and what would be the best way to achieve this,NONE

1111709119,question,help needed with custom flipnote style pattern brushes,the goal ive been wanting to replicate the style of flipnotes in my animation for a while now but dont know how i would go about making custom brushes if its possible to do so with what i want im aiming to replicate the 10 dither brushes found in this krita package its probably best if you use the pack to better understand what im wanting to make if making just the 10 dither brushes isnt too crazy of a thing i wouldnt be apposed to the idea of recreating the entire package for opentoonz either i have tons of free time pitching in if needed and really want this to happen as im sure there are more people than myself who like this style and would welcome opentoonz into their workflow if these brushes were available i dont have firsthand access to the flipnote software so this krita package is the most accurate parallel to the brushes on flipnote that are readily available to my knowledge concerns i dont have much technical knowledge of what goes into making custom brushes so im not sure how viable these dithering brushes are to make or use i have tried to make custom raster brushes in the past but to no avail enticement on my path to try and replicate the style i came across a like minded individual who also ran into this problem cs ghost animation youtuber not that it adds much but im sure he would appreciate the availability of these brushes as well since he has to copy and paste in order to obtain the dithering effect seen in flipnote,NONE

1250181863,question,standardize frame and image terminology and their related methods in imagingextractor,tldr in videos with multiple channels three colors the terms image and frame can mean an object with shape nchannels rows columns or an object with shape row columns i think we should decided which one is which and enforce their related methods to return objects with that shape by default particularly i think we should change getframes to return an object of size nchannels rows columns as now it mostly as in most of the methods in the instance classes returns objects of size row columns here i dont mind about the order just that the nchannels dimension should be there context the base class for imaging extractor has the following abstract methods looking at the first method there is a channel in the argument it seems that the original intention was for frame to mean an object of size row columns and some of the tests that i recently silenced are consistent with this assumption this has not been a problem so far because all of our io tests only have data with one channel but the recently added method can handle videos with three channels and the test above was supprsed my personal preference is for frame to mean nchannels rows columns and that image means rows columns you can see that thats a common understanding of the word and that opencv used to have like that as mentioned above following this convention would mean that getframes should return objects of size nchannels rows columns by default which is a small change in most of the classes that said maybe there is a better terminology or something that i am missing,CONTRIBUTOR

1182175565,question,java has no result for switch statements,codeqls seems to be intended to model switch rules where the right side is expression jls 17 §14111 this works correctly for switch expressions but for switch statements this codeql predicate does not have a result instead there the right side is modelled as exprstmt in this case example query ql import java from switchstmt s top e where e or e select s e egetprimaryqlclasses information getruleexpression has no results and instead getrulestatement has exprstmt entities as result this behavior is inconsistent and possibly also incorrect jls 17 §14112 explicitly covers this case saying every switch rule expression in the switch block is a statement expression §148 notice that it says statement expression while this sounds similar to expression statement as which codeql currently models it they are separate concepts a statement expression is contained within an expression statement if this behavior of codeql is considered intended it might be good to mention this in the documentation of getruleexpression to avoid incorrect behavior when users assume getruleexpression will have results and getrulestatement will only have block statements or throw statements as result,CONTRIBUTOR

1221707054,question,how to fix sharp buffers from leaking memory into rss and external,question about an existing feature what are you trying to achieve i deployed my nodejs code to heroku to realise that a few image manipulations with sharp pollute the rss memory that never ever gets freed up so after literally 10 requests to my endpoint my app crashes because the 512 mb limit of the heroku dyno is reached its been six hours since i have tried to fix this issue at first i thought it was a memory leak then i ruled that out but trying to run the garbage collector at the end of my endpoint nothing happened the rss and external memory were getting bigger and bigger with each request never getting freed up as time went on after countless hours googling around i found this is a thing that happens with buffers and or with sharp so i set the sharpcache to false and i installed jemalloc on my heroku server still the rss with each sharp composition keeps growing and growing and it is not something feasible to reset my server every 10 times my endpoint is called i know this is kind of a recurring problem but being a noob i have no idea why it happens and how to fix it is it because of sharp is it because of buffers and itll always be like this every time i use a buffer what can i do to make the os or whatever it is free up the rss literally the rss it is not being freed up after hours of my server being idle it just keeps building up and never frees up even if i exit my functions any tips when you searched for similar issues what did you find that might be related please provide a minimal standalone code sample without other dependencies that demonstrates this question i can only provide some pseudo code as the block of code is very big and dependent on other libraries my endpoint is something like this and i always resolve the promises at the end i would even call the garbage collector but it wouldnt help cleaning up the rss itd be amazing if someone could tell me how to clean up the rss apppostorder async function await a async function a await b async function b do lots of buffer stuff with sharp that is basically the skeleton of my code and apparently nodejs doesnt like it and pollutes the rss and never frees it up please provide sample images that help explain this question,NONE

803882402,question,security concerns with display instructions for credential,i am concerned about the security implications of having a credential manifest include display instructions the format includes no way of verifying that the display instructions correspond to exactly and only the data that a credential contains therefore a malicious issuer could construct an innocentlooking display but have a credential with content that does not match it an exaggerated example of how this could be exploited is that an employer could construct a letter of recommendation for alice and could have the display show a blue ribbon and 5 stars but could have a field in the credential that says to the verifier actually alice is a terrible employee dont hire her alice would not realize the true content of the credential because the display instructions that format for human consumption are quite different from the true content this is an exaggerated example but the general principle here is that display of a credential and content of a credential should be provably associated with one another if they are not the display becomes a vector for confusion ambiguity or manipulation i recommend removing the display attribute entirely and instead coming up with a standard algorithm that renders credential fields in a predictable way,NONE

1104928104,question,choice of network output and neuralnet criterion,i use pytorch for classification with onehotencoded labels im looking at this page it says when you use the neuralnetclassifier the criterion is set to pytorch nllloss by default furthermore if you don’t change it loss to another criterion neuralnetclassifier assumes that the module returns probabilities and will automatically apply a logarithm on them which is what nllloss expects the quickstart example in the docs suggests using fsoftmax on the output of the classifier network and uses the default value for the criterion in neuralnetclassifier which seems to be nllloss when training pytorch with manuallyselected hyperparameters the combinations that are most often used are linear output nncrossentropyloss logsoftmax output nnnllloss what if i want to write a model just once and then pass it without changes to skorch for hyperparameter tuning and then again train it on a data set without any extra transformations of the data the best option seem to be to just use a linear output with crossentropyloss if i have softmax on the output then in regular training id have to log the output then pass it to nllloss which seems like an unnecessary extra step why not just recommend using a linear output by default and have the default criterion in skorch be crossentropyloss,NONE

1256178960,question,question,video session takes too long to establish on the client streaming detailed description currently im trying to implement the webrtc streaming for an amr64 device i havent had any issues so far with the generation of the streaming by itself however i have found that the time elapsed from the moment the master receives the request until the streaming is seen on screen is too long between 20 and 23 seconds at this point ive tried the suggestions given by the kinesis team in other threads 1 filter network interfaces if the device has a bunch of network interfaces available it is possible candidates gathering time taken would be more if the customer wants candidate gathering to be done from specific interfaces the customer can follow this example to set up a filter callback regarding this suggestion ive placed the example filter into the following line as a callback 2 enforcing turn by doing this host and srflx candidates will not be gathered however it does not take too long to gather these candidates either so i am unsure how much improvement it would lead to could probably shave a second with not gathering srflx candidates but cannot say for sure we have not captured a way to enforce turn in readme yet however in order to enforce turn should be replaced with here 3 disable ipv6 based on the platform disabling ipv6 will help in not gathering ipv6 candidates that can reduce the latency as well in this case ive disabled the ipv6 with the sudo sh c echo 0 as sugested by you in other issues logging the logs go from the moment the channel is created until the video is displayed on the streaming console the request from the client to the master can be found at the timestamp 20220531 162833 sudo sh c echo 0 export awskvsloglevel2 xxxxxxx

1078560483,question,repo rearchitecture add pr validation check for ids in new quickstarts,description when creating new quickstarts a lot of contributors include id fields in the configyml usually copypasted from other quickstarts this leads to duplicate ids and we currently have to manually check for these during pr review we should add a pr validation check that identifies whether a quickstart is new and fails if the configyml contains an id field with appropriate instructions for the user virtuoso have confirmed that nerdgraph validation will not be able to identify if a quickstart is new or not so the check cant be done on that side this check should be performed before the nerdgraph validation check acceptance criteria create a new workflow job that checks whether a quickstart is new or updated checks whether a new quickstart has an id field provided if it does fail with appropriate instructions for the user checks to make sure an updated quickstart still has an id field includes tests,CONTRIBUTOR

1268139475,question,is highest fidelity or least effort the primary goal sublime text 4,context ive just installed sublime text 4 on my system and nothing was working right this led to me finding a few issues id copied over the mac keymap myself long ago the regex in kintosh is wrong on my system the wmclass is simply subl but since i was staring at a broken keymap that begged the question for serious apps that allow redefining all their keys completely wouldnt the highest fidelity experience be using their own native keymapping functionality and then telling kintos key mapping to just ignore that app completely this leads to the question because it does seem the best fidelity experience would be to remove the extra layer of keymapping and use the mac native keymap for sublime itself if possible but this might require a little more effort from users or from kintos setup to do this for the user im imagining something like py reignorecase no map use normal keys reignorecase no map use normal keys i dont think this will work currently sublime text since modmaps are exclusive this works already place this modmap early and it will match first and prevent any of the keys going to sublime from being modmapped now we just have global de navigation these could be added directly to the sublime keymap itself and they might even be easier to write now for the keymap though we have the small issue that keymaps are additive while sublime text is active many other keymaps will be active as well that could mess with sublimes nonmapped keys i see two solutions here you program any conflicting keys as passthru or literal this seems like it might be hard to maintain since every time you add a global keymap item you risk potentially breaking any apps unless youre going back and checking all the time we add the idea of an exclusive keymap that once the condition matches other keymaps in the stack are not consulted maybe we add the concept of global and exclusive so wed declare like general gui a global keymap and most apps as exclusive keymaps lets examine the last option a little more so when sublime is focused we might have modmap empty for sublime 3 we want to pass all keys straight modmap general system wide remapping keymap sublime 3 exclusive keymap generual gui global the problem i immediately see is how do you apply the general system wide modmap which is likely needed for the general gui keymap while having a nonmodmap for sublime text anyways the real issue here well see if i find more is how do you have the keymapper leave an app alone while also still allowing global de etc keymaps to be active ill be going to attempt going this route and using this thread to reportexplore issues and start this discussion im keeping in mind that this may require adding functionality to the keymapper and if its easy to reason about im totally fine with the need to do so i assume the reason we havent done this in the past are the problems ive mentioned above that would need to first be solved or does kintosh place more value on least effort is the existing remapping for sublime it would need to be fixed sufficient if its only 95 fidelity if having 100 fidelity by just using one file to change the apps entire keymap was within easy reach note im not saying the current system is less fidelity for sure but im betting it is since it doesnt seem to recognize my sublime at all and these things tend to age over time so even if it was 100 uptodate once have to manually maintain it across releases is going to likely result in breakage with time,NONE

1353163489,question,add ability to disable import ordering,in a large typescript codebase we use this pattern for avoiding circular import errors between files ie we create a barrel export file that all it does is export symbols from other files with a very specific order of export foo from foo export bar from bar and we dont want these reordered using dprintignorefile turns off formatting for the entire file but then bc this file is generated from some code generation templates that purposefully dont care about formatting the whole file ends up uglyunformatted so id like to disable only the import reordering but still get the rest of the dprint formatting could this be done via either a config parameter or an infile hint granted infile hints for specific behavior is not great but i think the general important of import ordering to runtime behaviorcorrectness makes this a valid exception we had been using and it has a that served this purpose thanks,NONE

1303465427,question,offtopic all app permissions in one place,hello d4rken the idea i spoke about earlier is about an app that will list all app permissions in one place currently android shows app permissions in 3 different places 1 app info page 2 special access 3 permissions manager in order to control or just see what permissions an app has access to the user has to go to 3 different places now this new app im suggesting will basically list every single permission an app has requested in one place giving the user a birds eye view of app permissions it will have two tabs at the bottom or top 1 apps this will list all the apps installed clicking on any app will list every single permission that the app has requested including those that show up under permissions manager and special access along with their status on off allowed disallowed etc 2 permissions this will list every single permission such as contacts microphone camera etc including those that show up under permissions manager and special access clicking on each will show all the apps that currently has access to that permission this will also include internet permissions shareduserid status in both the above cases it will be nice to segregate the output in two sections one where apps have been allowed a permission or permissions that an app currently has access to and another section where the same is denied due to limitations of android this app will not allow for controlling permissions from within the app atleast not without root instead it will provide a birds eye view of the entire permission set available to each app and also provide a shortcut to the appropriate system settings page if the user wants to change any currently there is not a single app that can do this so you may consider making one thanks,NONE

1061881090,question,question tqcs cpu usage,i have some general questions about why cpu usage might spike when resuming training from a checkpoint upon resuming training of a tqc agent from a saved checkpoint we see that cpu usage is very high when the resumed training job has a batch size nearly double that of the training job that produced the checkpoint more concretely suppose a training job was run with a batch size of 256 and called tqcsavecheckpoint1 at some point during training then we resume training starting at tqcloadcheckpoint1 in two different jobs 1 with batch size of 384 and 2 with batch size of 512 our experience is that resumed job 2 with the batch size of 512 shows 10x the cpu utilization as the original job and resumed job 1 with the batch size of 384 the original job and the resumed jobs have similar gpu usage if the resumed job isnt cpu bound the training speed doesnt appear to change either i am curious if there is anything about tqc specifically that would cause this type of behaviour or if this is more likely to be caused by something at the pytorch level sorry if this question doesnt belong here and thanks for all your work on stablebaselines3 and sb3contrib,NONE
