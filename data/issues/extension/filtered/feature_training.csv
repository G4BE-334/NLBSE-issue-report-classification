810137990,feature,create a corewebview2frame and add it to the eventargs,i have a use case where i automate a single website the main top document is loaded after login and the domcontentloaded event fires this top document then rarely navigates again it navigates if you logout or change the language for example the html changes via injections of html elements ajax in same cases but also has a number of iframes i see the comment here about corewebview2frame has that progressed at all my feature request is that in the that at least the name id and url could be identified even better would be that the event either passed a frame object or the browser object in my use case and working with for example chrome extensions or cefsharp the various frame events seem to fire before the html of the iframe is ready therefore it would be great that there be some way to know when this iframes document is ready i bring this up because you may consider adding a domcontentloaded event however i think this will cause a timing issue and may in same cases be set too late meaning it never fires ultimately a status property or even event change would be really nice this last part on document being ready of course is a nice to have as one could inject javascript into the frame to check the status ab31913810,NONE

1057629253,feature,covpasscheck 2g recent boosters introduce optional serial scanning of multiple dccs per user,this enhancement request for covpasscheck affects both android ios avoid duplicates x this enhancement request has not already been raised before searched all repos couldnt find anything current implementation currently covpasscheck scans 1 eu dcc per useruse case combining multiple eu dccs of one user for a single resultcheck is not implemented yet suggested enhancement please implement an optional serial scanning mode to covpasscheck that makes it possible to scan multiple eu dccs of one user combine them and validate them to a single result this would make it possible to easily check in situations where 2g or boosters probably in the future are required to enter a venue use case 2g whenever the proof of the status 2g vaccinated or recovered and tested negative is required to enter a venue it will be necessary to scan two independent eu dccs vaccinationrecovery certificate and test certificate if available in the current implementation a gate keeper would first need to scan one vrcertificate check whether its valid and then scan again the testcertificate if available as dcc gate keeper then needs to combine both results in his mind and decide whether entry to the venue can be granted for the holder this sounds a simple task at a glance not necessarily needing a serial scanning mode but try to imagine bigger events with many people hectic rush and distraction how often it could happen that the gate keeper accidently scans twice the same dcc eg twice the same test or twice the vdcc he just sees 2 times green and checks the holder in a serial scanning mode can support the gate keeper in this case after the first dcc is scanned covpasscheck prompts displays a message to the gate keeper which certificate is next to scan from the holder then combine both certificates to a single pass or fail and request the gate keeper to now scan the next guest in case the necessary proofs have different formats eg one is paper the other eu dcc the current scan then would need an option button to skip the second scan and switch to the next guest use case recent booster vaccination booster vaccination is a complex thing to validate because it needs to be determined whether the presented eu dcc is a recent booster after a completed vaccination series a 2x astrazeneca biontech moderna booster 33 b 1x jj booster 22 or a single vaccination after a recovery c vaccination 11 or a booster after a vaccination after a recovery d booster 22 currently when holders present their eu dcc its critical to determine whether its a booster or a vaccination when the booster has been received less than 14 days ago but according to legislation a booster is already valid and granting access to the venue with todays covpasscheck a single certificate with a 22 booster received less than 14 days ago would be rejected because in this case different dccs would need to be taken into account for people of the groups b and d the covpasscheck today cant give a valid result for this use case so it will likely need high awareness of the gate keeper and discussionquestions with holders to decide whether access can be granted this is error prone and slowing down the checkin it will become even more difficult for gate keepers with current covpasscheck if one day boosters are mandatory to gain access to a venue because then in many cases groups b and d its a must that multiple proofs need to be checked at least for recovered and jjjabbed people we are far away from that scenario in these days but its not completely unrealistic that this may happen one day covpasscheck could support the gate keeper in a serial mode when after scanning a 22 vdcc that was issued 14 days ago current days or when a booster is mandatory possible future days the gate keeper is prompted to ask forscan for a second proof that reflects that the 22 vdcc is actually a booster and after the scan of the necessary document display a pass or fail use case 2g together with boosters already today when 2g will need to be checked people will present their booster certificates together with a test result for the reasons described above this will become even more complex for gate keepers a serial mode of covpasscheck could take care of it reducing errors and speeding up the checkin expected benefits as described above reducing complexity and errors speeding up checkscheckin when handling 2g and booster dccs how to implement basically the multiple dccs that have been scanned and have been validated against their digital signature each can be then combined internally and then be checked using certlogic against special crafted booster notification rules bnr coronawarnapp is using this mechanism already to detect booster certificates stored in its wallet see for details for 2g this can easily be extended with test certificates covpasschecks scan logic would need to be extended accordingly to allow for multiple scans per holder using bnrs would most likely need to be adaptedextended ui would need to represent options to turn on serial mode and to present results accordingly it would also be nice when gate keepers can choose to use presets 2g with booster support 2g 3g with booster support or the presets could also determine whether a serial mode is to be switched on automatically,NONE

1294797632,feature,dev refactor liverates decorate shipping options instead of using cso,using csos for liverates has been bothersome from the start this implementation was the first working approach to get calculated shipping rates to show before the customer makes a choice the issue cso solves is that the calculateprice method gets invoked internally when a shipping method is created for the cart ie the shipping rate gets calculated after being added to the cart instead of before so that the customer could see the prices before making a choice medusa documentation is sparse forcing code analysis to figure things out cso works but it creates some issues after digging through the medusa core code it was discovered that there is a mechanism for implementing and running decorators on services there is no documentation for this so lets try to refactor liverates to use decorators and move away from csos in either case cso or decorators medusa has made implementing calculated shipping rates rather cumbersome the default behaviour is bizarre calculating the rate after it is added to the cart is too late for the show the customer wants to know the prices beforehand,OWNER

1245099029,feature,feature refactor pysrregressor to better support the scikitlearn interface,the current implementation of pysrregressor loosely supports interfacing with scikitlearn however when trying to use pysrregressor with scikitlearn functions such as x y it currently does not work i think poviding full compatibility with scikitlearn would for me at least be very useful the easiest way to provide this additional compatibility would be refactoring the pysrregressor to better conform with the scikitlearn estimator development docs to do this the following should be done 1 no input validation in init instead validation should be performed in fit 2 no kwargs in init 3 move init parameters that are not model hyperparameters into fit or predict eg tempdir and juliaproject are parameters that influence the execution of the model but not the models resultscore and thus should not be specified in init 4 by doing the above the custom setparams and getparams methods in pysrregressor can be removed allowing the inherited baseestimator to provide these methods this will make interfacing with scikitlearn functions such as crossvalscore much simpler 5 remove the score method in pysrregressor that is currently notimplemented the regressormixin that pysrregressor inherits provides a default scoring function that calculates an r2 score 6 estimated attributes such as should have trailing underscores eg these attributes are values that are expected to be overriden each time fit is called 7 docstrings are not in the perfered form potential negative consequences the biggest issue that i can see from making these modifications is the change to where execution parameters vs model hyperparameters are definied ie parameters that are currently passed to the pysrregressor constructor will need to be passed to fit instead this would require users of pysr to update their code to the new format similarly the current functionality to provide backwards compaitibility with decprecated keywords would be lost however personally given the potential to simplify the code and more easily support other scikitlearn functions i think the benefits outweigh the cons im really enjoying the package so far and i am more than happy to submit a pullrequest for all of the above changes,CONTRIBUTOR

1080043776,feature,default algorithm remove pipelineparams parameter and move functionality into,in 3149 theres a discussion noticing divergent behavior around pipeline parameters in defaultalgorithm and iterativealgorithm currently the implementation is as follows for the two algorithms default pipeline parameters are passed down to every pipeline of every batch iterative pipeline parameters are passed down only on the initial batch closing criteria of this issue should be as follows 1 determine whether pipeline parameters should be passed only on the first batch or for every batch 2 if pipeline parameters should be passed only on the first batch fix defaultalgorithm to do so 3 if pipeline parameters should be passed to every batch fix iterativealgorithm to do so this may just be a fundamental misunderstanding on my part when i implemented defaultalgorithm but happy to discuss further in this issue tagging parthivnaresh and freddyaboulton here edit jan 13th 2022 after discussion weve decided to do the following 1 remove pipelineparams as a parameter of defaultalgorithm 2 add functionality so that if a user wants to statically define a parameter for a component they can do so by specifying a single parameter for a hyperparameter for example random forest regressor nestimators 10 this was decided to minimize the confusion of having two parameters pipelineparams and do similar things in different stages of the algorithm for example in iterativealgorithm pipelineparams would function in the first batch but would take over the same functionality afterwards an added note of complexity is detailed here where we noticed that our tuner would error out if we passed values to the tuner that was not defined in the hyperparameter ranges for the tuner another open question should we do the same with iterativealgorithm,CONTRIBUTOR

559040857,feature,add support for programmatic cordapp deployment and serialization,a cordapp currently defines many things via annotations metainfservice declarations andor implicit marker interfaces including whitelists custom serializers flow endpoints serialization behavior the logic required to handle all of this is quite complex and hard to debug when something goes wrong see eg 5914 as a developer i would prefer to have a more reliable mechanism for deploying cordapps which didnt rely on reflection to pick up definitions but instead allowed me to explicitly specify everything via typed interfaces i wouldnt mind having to write my own serialization and deserialization methods for contract states and flow endpoints for example one possible approach would be to allow a corda node to be instantiated programmatically via a public api method thereby allowing node operators to build custom corda nodes tailored to a set of cordapps doing away with the cordapps folder since a corda node has to be rebooted when a cordapp changes anyway i dont think it would add many practical complications to the deployment since deployments should be automated anyway adding a build stage should also not be a problem on the other hand i think this model has several advantages the current model of loading cordapp jars from cordapps can still be supported and can be pulled out as a separate library more type errors can be caught in the build phase instead of causing runtime errors everything will run in the same classpath if it builds relative to this classpath then it will most likely also work at runtime but proper use of the new java module system or osgi would be needed to resolve all classpath issues since cordapp objects are explicitly instantiated in code dependencies between cordapps can be resolved by hand for example solving the problems that may arise due to cordapp services not starting up in the correct order,CONTRIBUTOR

309053117,feature,multiple integration support,goal currently the xray daemon sends data to the aws xray service this issue discusses the changes to be implemented to the existing design that supports multiple backends apart from the xray service current design the xray daemon receives segments on the xray daemon address each received segment has a daemon header the current design utilizes a global memory pool known as buffer pool preallocated on initialization default 1 of total memory for receiving the udp payload a ring buffer rb is a structure implemented using a channel and stores received segments using a goroutine the size of the rb is 250 segments and each segment in the rb maintains a pointer to a piece of buffer allocated in the buffer pool by default the buffer size is 64kb and we do not split large payload into multiple buffers a processor is on the receiver end of this rb channel and batches segments using a goroutine a batch is ready to be sent by the processor to a batch processor if it is large enough default 50 segments or the processor goroutine has hit an idle timeout default 1 second upon which the raw payload for the batch is serialized to strings and the buffer is returned to the buffer pool for reuse the batch processor uses xray client and sends batches to the xray service using the puttracesegments api modularization we intend to decouple components of the xray daemon so the segments batched by the xray daemon can be routed to the desired backend service the changes to the design are backward compatible and support the xray service by default client we create a xray client instance to use the puttracesegments api that sends data to the xray service the xray client implements xray interface which contains xray service api methods we will have another interface service name yet to be finalized which contains putsegments method a client structure will implement the service interface for the desired backend service the client will be a bridge between the xray daemon and the backend service registering client in the current design during initialization of the processor instance the xray client is created and set to the batch processor instance when the batch of segments is ready to be sent the batch processor instance uses the xray client to send data to the xray service this part needs to be restructured and the client xray client will be created as a part of daemon initialization and passed to the processor instance once the batch processor instance is configured with the client xray client existing architecture will send the batch of segments to the configured backend service note these are initial thoughts on modularizing the xray daemon your suggestions are welcome,CONTRIBUTOR

1202976307,feature,feature replace glob with fastglob for proj file search in projectgraph calculation,is your feature request related to a problem please describe when trying to introduce nx with nxdotnet to a large existing solution with about 70 projects i figured out that the project graph calculation took several minutes by debugging the nxdotnet plugin i found out that the glob search for proj files took about 3 minutes due to the fact that i did not use the nx dist dir as output directory but the normal bin directory within the project directory to avoid to much changes to the repository structure and build architecture for now describe the solution youd like 1 by replacing glob with fastglob locally i was able to reduce the execution time of the projectgraph calculation from 3 min to 30 sec so i would like to suggest using fastglob which is used by nx as well 2 optionally by passing the ignore option to glob fastglob like bin obj it is possible to speed up the calculation even more fastglob took 15 sec whereas glob took 35 sec describe alternatives youve considered changing the output directories to the normal nx dist directory could be an option to speed up the execution but that would possibly interfere with our current build architecture and would cause more concerns from some developers against introducing nx workspace,NONE

646780657,feature,support trusts when you support private,the context of this feature request is when cor the object orientation system supports private in contrast with perls traditional way of everything being public i feel that it is important to have a mechanism where otherwiseprivate methods and maybe also attributes but at least methods can be effectively public within an inner circle of related and codeveloped classes the main use case is when a feature conceptually presents a single unified api but for technical reasons has to be implemented using multiple classes the set of classes that together implement something in common can see each others privates but external users of the collection can not an example of this is a factory pattern such as a container and interconnected elements of the container where a container object must be used to create element objects and users may not instantiate an element object directly conceptually the dbi ecosystem would be an example with the interconnectedness of connection handles and statement handles that collectively are a single api and both kinds of objects would link to each other internally the requested feature manifests in different forms depending on the host language raku calls it trusts net calls it internal scope java calls it packageprivate scope personally i like the net model the most but it relies on the concept of assemblies which is more unique to net when entities are declared internal then anything in the same assembly can access it like it is public the assembly is loosely the net analogy to a cpan distribution lib folder or a java jar or a dll and is a multilevel namespace the java model is fundamentally deficient in contrast where the scope includes anything declared in the exact same namespace and only that namespace which limits the organization of a class group across a hierarchy and also allows access by tests or other parties code that is declared in the same java package namespace the raku model seems to be the best one for perl to emulate it doesnt rely on assembly concepts and is strictly on an individual classbyclass basis each class declares that it trusts one or more other classes and only those named classes have the special privilege since the feature request is only meant to exist within codeveloped classes by the same author and is not meant to be about thirdparty extension being closed to known parties is the whole point the simplest implementation is just on a wholeclass level where class x just declares it trusts class y and then class y can invoke all of the private methods of class x but no one else can another option which adds complexity but also control is we can have an extra scope such as trusting that is an alternative to private or public that methods can be declared with such that only those methods in x declared trusting may be invoked by y and private is still restricted to x this is what netjava do whereas i recall raku is just all or none the simpler wholeclass option is all i require but this additional granularity is gravy if available a related feature request is that whole classes can be marked private or trusting this is for when classes are only meant to be used internally and not be part of a public api a related feature request is that constructors of classes can independently be marked private or trusting which controls how objects can be instantiated so in the dbi analogy a statement class would be public but its constructor would be trusting so that only a connection object may instantiate a statement object but the public can then use it please let me know if you have any questions,NONE

1089031309,feature,improvement support for multiple remote kimai endpoints as profiles,as a freelancer i have several customers with their own kimai installations i want to be able to save the connection details as profiles for each of these servers so i can quickly start a new work session without having to enter the credentials every time i have started this in a fork and come quite far i have created this issue in order to have some tracking when the pull request is submitted if this is the wrong workflow please correct me my approach to this is by using sqlite as storage engine not only because of its good support on all platforms but also for a good abstraction layer regarding data exchange between the current application state and disk storage side note this also enables for future improvements by having a sql based storage engine for profiles in a centralized sql compatible storage engine for example in enterprise conditions with managed user catalogues this is however out of the scope of this project the user interface will consist of an extra view for adding and editing connections as well as a dropdown in the main tracker window for quick selection of the profile to be used upon changing profile the customer tasks and activity dropdowns are populated with data from the selected backend endpoint i have come very far with this pr and are now merging the current release 06 with fork,NONE

1163109562,feature,select sql endpoint at runtime via model configuration,describe the feature databricks sql has endpoints that are tshirt sized similar to snowflake warehouses models with a lot of rows need larger endpoints but these would be overkill for smaller models when using the snowflake adapter it is easy to rightsize the warehouse via configuration however in the databricks adapter the endpoint is selected in the profile this feature would bring the databricks adapter to parity with snowflake allowing the endpoint to be set via configuration and override what is in the profile describe alternatives youve considered the workaround is to use env vars in the profile and make multiple invocations of dbt large models can be tagged as such and selected via normal model selection mechanisms but this could get quite sticky depending on the topology of the dag and it may not be possible to know a priori how many invocations you would need to cover the whole dag who will this benefit this will benefit anybody running databricks sql who has sufficient number and diversity of models such that some are much larger than others and would be more efficiently run on a larger endpoint are you interested in contributing this feature yes i would likely just need some advice on approach to get started and occasional help if i get stuck,NONE

1189146606,feature,api overhaul,as core approaches 10 there are a few last changes that should be made to the interface api in the remote tools interface of these changes the following proposals should help streamline integration of 3rd party providers with netman as well as allow a more open approach for edgecase style usage of the provider system 1 the api requirements should be reduced to the following required variablesfunctions write replaces writefile read replaces readfile and readdirectory delete replaces deletefile and deletedirectory name no change protocolpatterns no change version no change parseuri replaces getdetails initconnection new but will also replace getuniquename 2 adding optional functions that can be implemented and will be called in the lifecycle of a remote buffer connection init change the signature to return a boolean for successful initialization if implemented closeconnection new can be used to perform any sort of cache cleanup after a remote buffer is closed justification renaming and reducing it to just read helps make the function more concise and eliminates the potential for developers to believe netman is purely file based think outside the box for providers reduce end user confusion make reading clear and concise reduce complexity for integration renaming writefile and removing createdirectory reducing to just write helps to reduce confusion on what exactly should be called when you wish to make changes there is no spec for create as creating a new file is simply writing that new file to the filesystem reduce end user confusion make writing clear and concise reduce complexity for integration renaming falls into the same idea as readfiledirectory in that it helps reduce confusion on which to call delete deletes it doesnt care if its a file or directory it just expects it to be gone reduce end user confusion make deletion clear and concise reduce complexity for integration renaming getdetails to parseuri is more concise on its functionality parse uri should get as much detail as possible from a single string input as well as any assumptions that the provider can make about the string without resolving the uri reduce documentation confusion reduce complexity for integration adding initconnection as a required function will allow netman to prompt the provider for valid connection details as well as give the provider an opportunity to resolve connection conflicts required passwords for authentication for example additionally the object that is returned from this will now have a unique name associated with it allowing this function to wrap the previous getuniquename function that was used for file locking allow provider developer the ability to properly handle caching connections reduce complexity for integration consuming a returned boolean from a providers init allows the provider a means of communication to inform netman it is not able to run currently netman will accept this and not use the listed provider for matching uris allow provider developer the ability to decline being used due to missing dependencies for example allowing an optional closeconnection function will allow the provider to better handle connection cachingmanagement allow provider developer the ability to better manage caching connections these changes will be made and tested as the final api modification before 10 and thus will be considered stable,OWNER

1302374997,feature,week 9 qtl module,introduction instead of writing this weeks exercise in a google doc i am writing it in this github issues post i am doing this to give us all practice working collaboratively via github as it is important to keep record of any errors coding changes etc in github rather than in textemail so that when you inevitably encounter similar issues in the future you dont have to sort through months worth of ambiguouslynamed emails to find the solution communication etiquette for this week and for any github issue troubleshooting if you encounter an error in troubleshooting your code respond to this post with the following information 1 the inputs you used 2 the error you got 3 what you have tried and what happened when you tried those things be sure to push commit the problematic code so that i can replicate your error finishing when you successfully finish a submodule push commit your changes to github and write in the description of your push commit the submodule that you finished once all submodules are finished respond to this github issue post saying that you have finished coding the example app and i will check your code this weeks exercise has multiple parts described below i will check part i before we move to subsequent parts so we likely will need to meet between parts i ii to discuss any corrections for all code this week we will be working out of the qtltroubleshooting folder located outside of the main cavecrawler folder part 1 mini function module goal use the provided skeleton scripts functionsr and appr in qtltroubleshooting folder of the cavecrawler github repository to create a fullyfunctional qtl module which is independent of the main cavecrawler script timecommitment responsibility delegation i want yall to complete the preparation section together but to divvy up the submodules based on your interests the code for the traittomarker submodule will be less timeconsuming than the code for genomic range and marker range but the latter two will be interconnected keep these time commitments in mind when divvying up responsibilities this week 11 preparation goal prepare the functionsr and appr scripts to begin troubleshooting the cavecrawler qtl module instructions 1 navigate to qtltroubleshooting and read the instructions at the beginning of functionsr lines 116 and appr lines 114 if you have any questions dont be afraid to ask me 2 controlf for any comments in functionsr and appr in qtltroubleshooting which begin with todo p and follow the instructions presented in these comments

that segment of the scaffold instructions 1 controlf for any comments in functionsr in qtltroubleshooting which begin with todo gr and follow the instructions presented in these comments troubleshooting these changes may require creating multiple scratch scripts to test new portions of code 2 once youve troubleshot the function portion of your submodule controlf for any comments in

potentially meeting to discuss any issues i will code the plotting described in the july 13th meeting part 3 integration goal integrate the code we made in parts i ii into the official appr and
