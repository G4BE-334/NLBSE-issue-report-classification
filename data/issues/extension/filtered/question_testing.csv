1373124689,question,reproduce response curves from a previous model,hi first of all thank you for this amazing package ive built a multilinear regression model frequentist no bayes using this transformation for the data beta 1 expx slope where beta here is the media coefficients i want to transition from this model to a bayesian framework using your package i am using the hilladstock model where i am using the betas i found with the linear regression as media priors and the slope found with the linear regression as halflife priors i am setting the slope of the hill function to a halfnormal with 05 scale my goal here would be to get the response curves of the bayesian model as close as possible to the response curves of my previous model so that i can then use the posteriors i get from the bayesian model as priors for a new bayesian mmm with new data my understanding is that the media priors are the scale of a halfnormal distribution whose samples are the coefficients of the media activity terms in the model so it should regulate the height of the response curve half life instead determines the point at which the response curve is at half its maximum so it should control the uplift or how rapidly the curve increases the slope should determine the shape of the curve so setting it to 1 gets us a shape more like the upper half of a c rather than an s shaped curve ive been trying with different prior distributions even changing the media prior distribution in modelspy to a normal distribution centered on those beta values however the shape of the response curves is unpredictable and i cannot get it close to my original response curves do you have any suggestions on how to go about this am i interpreting the parameters wrong again thanks a lot for your work,NONE

to help the community and maintainers prioritize this request please do not leave 1 or other comments that do not add relevant new information or questions they generate extra noise for issue followers and do not help prioritize the request if you are interested in working on this issue or have submitted a pull request please leave a comment overview of the issue running into the same issue as in prev issue its caused by security settings in centos stream 9 and other modern distros that disallow incoming rsa connections that utilize a key with sha1 signature this was caused by an issue in the go crypto package although nywilken mentioned the latest version of packer is now built using a version of go that has the fix for this however using that version 181 and latest version 183 my build still fails im using the latest version of amazonebs plugin 131 and made sure to manually uninstall and reinstall it as well if this issue is specific to amazonebs i can open an issue on

1315039574,question,create query param object from query param list,hi first off thanks for all the effort in creating and maintaining this library i have a question that i cant seem to figure out an answer to regarding using this library with express and expressopenapi and that i was hoping you could shed some light on in short im wondering if there is a way to create a record from query parameters via fromschema a little more context the openapi spec requires you to type query parameters as a list of objects these objects have a name a type description and so forth but it is a list of speclike objects something like ts const params name paramname schema type string in query as const for endpoints that accept json payloads using fromschema to generate types has gone very smoothly but it seems to be a bit trickier with query parameters express types out the request as something like this ts req request where queryparamobject is an object with query param names as keys and corresponding types my problem is that id like to convert the list of query parameters into something that fromschema can parse so that we get a nice generated type based on the schema but i cant figure out how to do it the list is obviously not a schema in and of itself but its easy enough to map it so that it becomes the equivalent of a properties object on an objecttype schema however i keep running into issues with readonly and type inference and im just not making any headway do you have any suggestions as to what i could do here sorry if this doesnt actually apply to this library i was not the one who set everything up for the project so im not entirely sure how everything is wired together i do know though that the fromschema method does a lot of our type conversion and that the internals looked pretty intimidating it may well be that this is outside of what this package is responsible for but i thought id try this as my first port of call thanks very much for any tips tricks and insights you can offer,NONE

1321644152,question,question imperative time passages,hi everyone ive been working with vroom recently for the first time and there is a something im wondering our client wants a truck to go do a job on a same location n times we solved this by creating as many new jobs as the number of times the clients wants the truck to go but the other problem is that this location needs to be checked specifically x hours after the first one is done non less non more by default vroom would return something like this type job location arrival 30000 duration 244 distance 2436 job 1 service 300 type job location arrival 30300 duration 244 distance 2436 job 1001 service 300 type job location arrival 30600 duration 244 distance 2436 job 1002 service 300 waitingtime 600 in this simple example we only have this recurrent job main being 1 repeated as many times as the client needs to i understand if there are tasks between both of them vroom would add them but it could also tell us that there is a waitingtime of x hours this makes sense since vroom is supposed to find the most efficient path but in our usecase this is not possible not more than 5 minutes what we did is to check the vroom ouput and compute the difference between the arrival time of the n1 and first job if we dont have the desired interval time we modify our orignal request adding the missing time to the n1 job this is repeated until we get what we want it works as it is but i think there is a better way to do this and to avoid sending requests to vroom any insight would be greatly appreciated,NONE

1224223374,question,cpu increase to 100 after a x period of time,hi im using redisson v3170 with a redis v626 in sentinel configuration i am having this issue in which after a certain period of time our applications using redisson get their cpu usage raised to 100 this happens on three applications at different time and is always after certain amount of time after the deployment the pod after a few minutes of high cpu usage restarts because of the livenessreadiness probe imagen ive deployed one of these applications without forwarding traffic to it and still the problem appeared ive deployed one of these applications without livenesssreadiness probe and executed manually the program and when the cpu went 100 i saw that data was getting queued in the receive buffer queue as the application was unable to get the data for only one of the connections to redis like one getting stuck make the others unusable i was able to see this with the netstat command the logs only say that redisson was unable to send ping commands over the channel for only one redis node the others connections seems to work ok imagen setting nettythreads to 16 32 and 64 made this issue appear 7 hours after the program execution setting it to 128 made it appear 12 hours instead of 7 i went through the faq section but we couldnt make it any better all netty threads are busy leading to delays in both redis response decoding and sending commands to redis ive increased the amount of nettythreads but it doesnt fix the problem only mitigate it all connections are busy i think the problem is only one connection that get stuck but i dont know really how it works redis server takes too long to respond the request the incident appears in a application while the others continue working without any problem also redis can be queried manually without any visible problem sync methods invocation in asyncreactiverx listeners i dont think this is a problem because we deployed the application without forwarding traffic to it and the only operations that it was executing were the one related to sentinel sync configuration this error appeared with the default settings we only set sentineladresses username password mastername i tried to increase the amount of nettythreads from 32 64 and 128 but the error continues i decreased the amount slave connections to 10 and master connections to 5 i saw this problem is similar to others treated in this bug tracker but the solution applied didnt worked for us and instead of blindly changing configuration parameters i wanted to ask where you think this problem would come from,NONE

1109852293,question,kudos on glitch template update questions about datastores,description hi i started working with slack apps about a month ago with my introduction being the very useful hello world bolt highvoltage building your very first app with bolt tutorial i just noticed the recent updates to the tutorial and the glitch project template it references today and i think they move things in a great direction i like how the updates make it so a firsttime slack dev is able to see the hello world app being responsive in a clearer way sooner and then get exposure to block kit and modals in part two my questions have to do with a file in the new glitch project template named storejs which starts with the comment this is not a real datastore but it can be if you make it one this file caught my eye because in the quickanddirty prototype slack app im currently working on i use arrays to store data for undefined lengths of time which feels like maybe a bad smell poor practice though im honestly not sure datastores are something id love to learn more about but right now my biggest questions are fundamental andor specific things im having trouble answering through my own internet research im hoping to get help answering the following questions 1 im currently using arrays to track things like slack users participating in an activity along with associated info such as preferences and whether or not theyve completed daily actions available to them and objects created by users along with associated info such as a history of to that object is it appropriate to use arrays to store this kind of stuff would a datastore be better or overkill if using a datastore would be better why is that 2 based on this previous question answer it sounds like if a datastore is a good way for me to go then mongodb could be a good fit for my needs since im planning on deploying to heroku is mongodb something i could start using while im still developing my project on glitch or can it only work after the app is deployed if it wont start working til after ive deployed how can i test my app predeployment ive found a bit of mongodb documentation that may help answer this question deploy a replica set for testing and development am i pointed in the right direction 3 what would i need to do to the storejs file in my remixed glitch project in order to make it a real datastore my hope is that getting these questions answered will give me the context i need to keep learning more on my own through documentationreading and trialanderror thanks so much what type of issue is this place an x in one of the bug enhancement feature request x question documentation related example code related testing related discussion requirements place an x in each of the x ive read and understood the contributing guidelines and have done my best effort to follow them x ive read and agree to the code of conduct x ive searched for any related issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue,NONE

1299322079,question,where i can post a question for google docs,hello i have 2 big text files i want to translate from russian to english i found google says it can translate big files in pdf format so i convert both text files to pdf files one file is 99mb about 110000 pages another one is 62mb about 6060 pages when i tried to translate them using googletranslate it seems the file size set by google transate for 10mb is simply fake it actually set the pages limit to only 300 worse than this was that google didnt tell the truth it simply lied to you that you can try to translate it after a few minutes so even for the smallest one pdf file which has 6060 pages the translation is simply a mission impossible and i also found that google says you can use google docs to translate big documents so i upload the smaller pdf file which is 62mb to google drive then upload it then i can open it with google docs i also tried to translate the documents with google docs the translation seems finished successfully but when i looked at the translated document i found there is only the first 91 pages in google docs and only the first 18 pages were translated 6000 pages were totally missing later on i tried to reload the pdf many times with different google accounts however this time it is even worse when i open pdf file in google docs to view i can only load the first 80 pages i cant load more than this number of pages i think if someone has one small pdf for about 100 pages then you will find if google docs can translate it or not so my question is where i can file a complain that those google services like google translate or google docs cant do the translation for not so big file google docs is even worse it cant open pdf file for more than 80 pages please advise,NONE

sense polar h10 polar h9 other device is not relevant for this question description we noticed that the battery level may be reported with some quite high delay specifically when user puts their device to charge overnight and neither it has been explicitly disconnected nor the app has been closed when the device reconnects with the app it will not report the real battery level until it actually changes this causes a problem on our side as the latest value the app is aware of is eg 10 we were wondering if theres a way to query for battery level explicitly on reconnection swift

1222833940,question,zim files cannot be split properly split files almost never work mobile kiwix dead no wikipedia,from what i have gathered the support of split zim files has been dropped entirely because it didnt really work to begin with here is what i know to be true about that 1 any and all regular android phones do not support any other file system than fat32 on sd cards and thus require zim files to be split into chunks that are smaller than 4gb in order to work at all it is entirely untrue that extfat ntfs or even ext4 are available options in stock android both to recent and also obsolete android versions only custom roms may support different file systems if that has been specifically added as a feature different from the default android behavior which is to reject any file system other than fat32 even though the kernel obviously has support those custom roms can be found eg on xdadeveloperscom they void your warranty and they require you to root your phone which is often not possible without resorting to shady untrusted recovery image blobs for less popular phone brands also rooting your phone nowadays requires wiping the entire phone first very very very few if any but one or two manufacturers use custom preinstalled roms such as samsung modified to have ntfs and extfat enabled for sd cards this is highly unusual even within the samsung brand many samsung phone models may not even have this modification and samsung might drop it any time eg when they switch to a newer codebase also highly unusual is how samsungs custom roms handle encryption on sd cards in regular unrooted android and i believe in all versions of it as well if the phone has been once encrypted which is the default for most phones since years and years and it cant be reversed the sd card is automatically also encrpyted if not formatted as fat32 but as internal storage ie ext4 inside a dmcrypt instead in unrooted stock android there is no option or trick to decrypt a once encrpyted sd card but on certain newer samsung phones there is thus if formatted in this manner the card can never ever be used on any external device no matter what operating system or tools you use the data can never be backed up in a safe and direct way and basically your sd cards data is lost if the phone dies or any other hardware problems arise to most users who store much much more than just wikipedia on their sd card this is just highly inacceptable and why the card still needs to be fat32 in all cases up to this day with all phones that dont run modified roms 2 almost all zim files eg wikipedia cannot and could never be split into chunks smaller than 4gb this is because they all contain certain internal parts most notably the search index which is always destined to easily exceed the 4gb limit in direct proportion to the size of the zim file even in zim files as small as 12gb eg wikipedia mini i was told that as an ugly hack you can still use unixtools to split those unsplitable parts this would be necessary for the files to still work at all but it renders those parts useless so without the search index you cant search anything in the file anymore which makes this hack highly unviable also by reading other issues i got the strong impression that split file support has been dropped and left in the codebase only as an unmaintained remnant i was not even able to open wikipedia mini with kiwixdesktop after i split the 12gb zim file properly and regularly with zimtools and i left the 5gb part at the end search index as it was as i understand it kiwix has long been in a state where it is not expected to be able to reliably deal with any sort of splitting of files 4 this leaves only one conclusion generally speaking large zim files do not work on android kiwix does not work without zim files mobile kiwix is dead for wikipedia and project gutenberg this is of course not denying that as mentioned people with custom roms andor rooted phones can use ntfs on their sd cards and get kiwix to work you have probably heard people report about being successful with that but this is simply not a standard option if you got the impression that lack of extfat or ntfs support is maybe a fluke that might occur only to some android brands or only with older android versions this is totally not the case the opposite is true it is what happens on all android phones with all android versions unless the phone rom has been specifically modded to eliminate this problem people with regular phones and regular android cant use kiwix to read wikipedia or any other larger zim files from sd cards because the cards cannot be directly formatted with anything but fat32 and there are no workarounds to that i just wanted to write this issue to clarify on the facts of this situation and to ask if the team would be willing to address this issue or what it possibly took for outside devs to repair this problem i would be very happy to see wikipedia to make a return to mobile kiwix since that is basically just by far most the 1 use case for it damn it was even developed just for this purpose there must be something we can do to bring it back,NONE

757974523,question,oco functionality and confirmation of order execution,os ubuntu 1910 linux programming language version python 37 ccxt version 13438 hi there i have been following these links to gather information on the use of oco on this particular link for example you have 300 usdt in your account and you think the overall trend of the bnbusdt market is going up you want to enter the market at a reasonable price the last traded price of bnb is 2805 usdt and the resistance is around 2950 usdt you want to buy bnb when it hits 2700 usdt but you also don’t want to miss out on the opportunity when the price breaks the resistance price for the part of when it hits 2700 usdt but you also don’t want to miss out on the opportunity can you clarify does this mean that the oco is for a i want to buy it at a cheaper price but if i cant i will get some at any price also can you confirm this functionality appears to create an order only it is just you would get it at a cheap price or an expensive price so one would have to create a stop loss order after the buy order goes through question is there a way to get an alert once the order has been filled or does one have to constantly poll the order number to see if the status has changed from new to filled this would be fine for market orders as they fill pretty fast one can poll the results every 5 seconds but for limit orders these could take days to fill and it would seem that polling every 5 seconds to check if the status has changed from new to filled could get ones account banned is there some way to come about this,NONE

1149185858,question,setting heating temperature and selected flow temperature values get overwritten by the boiler after 60s,why the value of selected flow temperature gets changed back to the heating temperature value after about 60s i want to be able to set my heating temperature based on readings from my room temperature sensors and local weather info provider i have buderus logamax u05224k without any external controlling thermostat installed and bbqkees gateway s32 on v340b7 with ht3 set as mode because ems gives me tx errors and the service manual of logamax u05224k says that it uses ubah3 board which is short of heatronics3 i guess so before coding it all i tried using the gui dashboard to set the heating temperature i see in the logs event that the write telegram was successfully sent sending write tx 159 telegram 0b 08 16 01 32 but the heating temperature remains set to what is set via the hardware dial that is my first issue 20220224 132722900 d 563 emsesp last

discussion of 359 i read that i should set the heating temperature to the max value of the range that i plan to use and change the selected flow temperature instead so i have tried that and it somewhat worked after changing the selected flow temperature to a different always lower than heating temperature value it changes and a new readonly value set flow temperature gets added to dashboard which is the value which i set if i keep the gui open and refresh once per minute the value of selected flow temperature remains the same as the value of set flow temperature however if i close the webpage or do not refresh it for some time the value of set flow temperature gets changed to the value of the heating temperature by the boiler i guess as i havent sent any write commands and do not see any in the logs and the strange thing is that the readonly value set flow temperature remains set to what i set it to via the write command so my question is how to control the heating temperature in a way that it remains set to whatever i set it via the ems gateway and not get overwritten offtopic the value of burner selected max power is wrong it should be 50 that is what i set via the service menu i even checked it again after installing the gateway but is reported as 27 i guess that should be reported as another issue screenshots img width513 altscreenshot 20220224 at 13 04 35 src

1051349706,question,sphinxify licensing,i was tracking down the history of the sphinxify licensing to clarify how this sphinxify module is bsd while the core sage sphinxify is currently gplv2 here is what i found the sphinxify module was originally created in the sage notebook project in 2009 by timdumol under the bsd license from the commit diff it appears to have replaced disabled code that called sphinx see also even though the sage notebook was under a gpl license the sphinxify file itself was bsdlicensed sphinxify gradually evolved in the sage notebook codebase and the file continued to be licensed bsd in 2015 ccordoba12 started what would become the docrepr project and seems to have forked this bsdlicensed sphinxify module so now we have two parallel tracks for sphinxify one in docrepr and one in sage sage sphinxify develops further and in 2016 jdemeyer forks sphinxify again to create a new version in core sage sage notebook the original sphinxify module continues to develop in sage notebook and in 2019 is deleted and replaced with an import of the core sage version core sage the core sage sphinxify module continues to develop and in 2018 is relicensed to gplv2 with tims permission for consistency with the rest of sage docrepr in carlos project sphinxify continues to be developed as a bsdlicensed module with its history transitioning over several file renamings the history of the current file is i dont think there is anything to do and this ticket can be closed immediately but i just wanted to document the history to prevent confusion personal side note if i recall correctly i remember having a conversation about the bsd license on the original sphinxify module at sagedays 19 with tim and a few others where we decided it would be fine to have a bsdlicensed file in the sage notebook codebase but that wed just make sure that file explicitly stated it had the bsd license,NONE

1321606945,question,using firebase firestore listener with firebase authentication freezes in editor every time,do not delete validatetemplatetrue unity editor version 2021218f1 firebase unity sdk version 910 source you installed the sdk unity package unitypackage or unity package manager problematic firebase component auth auth database etc other firebase components in use firestore auth database etc additional sdks you are using facebook admob etc platform you are using the unity editor on windows mac windows or linux platform you are targeting android ios android andor desktop scripting runtime il2cpp mono andor il2cpp required please describe the issue here followed the tutorial on the firebase youtube channel for firestore listener that updates on firestore and on the game as a text field using a getcharacterdata script that uses a characterdata struct to listen for updates and a setcharacterdata script for writing to firestore from input fields on button press the game also has a login and registration function with firebase authentication in a seperate auth script both the set of 3 firestore scripts and the 1 authentication scripts work fine alone the issue that keeps occurring is when both are included the unity editor freezes when running the game to test removing either of them solves this for the other is there a way to use authentication and firestore in the same app that will resolve this issue i get no error codes the editor just freezes on run based on it crashing i assume the issue is the start function setting firestore as a default instance of firebase and running the listener on the getplayerdata script or the initialize firebase on the awake function for authentication on the auth script i am guessing they are clashing since removing the game object with the scripts solves the issues for the other and does not crash the game when running the unity editor sorry if this was too detailed or not detailed enough this is my first question on here i have honestly tried so hard to make this work and have hit a full dead end with no error codes to guide me and no documentation that solves this issue any help would be

1158555711,question,issue with oauth2proxy and okta interconnection,hello team we have very specific problem trying to set up oauth2proxy to proxy identity requests to our okta identity provider the problem is that okta uses something called thin tokens according the docs id token when returned along with access token is considered thin token thin id token only carries base claims and some scope dependent claims profile attributes even if profile scope is passed and groups are skipped even if groups scope is passed in authorize request examples of when id token and access token are returned together implicit flow where authorization code flow where openid scope is passed in authorize request resource owner password flow where openid scope is passed in token request we need our profile claims to make a decision whether to authorize request or not since identity token doesnt contain these claims we could use profileurl and make some extra calls to get these claims when the claims are gotten from the userinfo endpoint we can set only one of them via oidcgroupsclaim and xauthrequestgroups header to overcome this problem i followed the instruction i tried to set up oauth2proxy with alphaconfigurationto be capable to inject claims into headers and use its for authorization my alphaconfig looks like the following upstreamconfig upstreams id oauth2proxy static true path server bindaddress 00008080 providers provider oidc id oauth2proxy clientid clientsecret profileurl scope openid email groups profile oidcconfig groupsclaim nameofthecustomclaim issuerurl insecureskipnonce true general config contains only the following emaildomains com the idea is to set required headers afterwhen the basic config is working fine currently im getting redirected to okta going through authentication procedure getting callback and then getting the 403 error in the proxy logs i can see the following 20220303 152154 oauthproxygo730 error creating session during oauth2 callback neither the idtoken nor the profileurl set an email 6193322355046 20220303 152154 nginxechoheaders get http11 500 2810 0141 and have no idea how to solve it this set up worked before when i used general config which means okta application set up correctly could you please let me know 1is there any way how to push claims gotten from the userinfo endpoint to the upstream 2maybe you can see some obvious errors in my config which is preventing me from getting email in the id token thanks a million in advance and sorry for nube question im still very new in it,NONE

1332565411,question,clarification on versioning and api compatibilty,im currently evaluating if k6 is a right fit for my organization and i really like what ive seen so far but i havent been able to find any information on the versioning policy or compatibility guarantees if any for the javascript api im guessing k6 follows semantic versioning and since the major version is 0 that means anything can change at any point major version zero 0yz is for initial development anything may change at any time the public api should not be considered stable but the docs have a note under k6netgrpc that says the k6 grpc api is currently considered in beta and is subject to change which implies that the other apis are not considered beta so im confused is there anything in the api that can be considered stable or could every release potentially force us to rewrite all our tests if the latter are there any plans to establish compatibility guarantees thanks in advance,NONE

1123290977,question,ability to install noncurated packages at own risk,hello this project peaks my interest because it can serve as a potential replacement for nugetforunity which is nice since nugetforunity has been on life support for a while and builds on top of the unity package system with manifestjson which unifies the experience of installing unity and nuget packages when i was trying it out just now i ran into the notice that its apparently just a curated list of packages i understand this decision and its clearly documented in the readme but i was wondering if there would be a way to implement an at your own risk uncurated package import somehow eg by using a special version number prefix or a different registry prefix such as orgnugetuncurated or similar the reason im asking is because a curated list is always going to have to play catchup to official nuget packages even if those are working without problems in unity for example the small set of five packages fakeiteasy and their dependencies we need for our use case are not available in the curated list but working fine in unity we could of course upstream these fairly easily but we will be blocked again when we want to try out a nuget package that we wont know yet is suitable for us in the future and we cant easily test if they work properly in unity without first including them through a package manager which we cant with a curated list similarly a related nice to have would be if we could use unitynuget to easily install nuget packages from private nuget registries we can always selfhost this project but if it can automatically pull uncurated packages from the official nuget registry doing the same from a private registry is probably a small step even if it requires selfhosting and configuring the target url of the private registry,NONE

1070595447,question,how to connect to a device despite failed bonding,hi thanks for the library really useful for us so far we have this bluetooth lowenergy device which initiates bonding as soon as a connection is established however we dont need to bond to the device and instead need to use the device without bonding weve noticed that calling blemanagerconnect however always fails if the initial bonding fails this makes it impossible for us to actually interact with the device from looking through the code ive noticed that if the bond sate goes from bondbonding to bondnone service discovery is never even performed so then connect fails in the end using is not an option for us since that one only works if we can determine a delay long enough for bonding to already fail but short enough for the bluetooth device to not time out our connection request we cant change how the bluetooth device works and noticed that we get disconnected from the gatt server immediately after the bonding request fails any way to work around this ideally blemanagerconnect would connect to the gatt server perform service discovery regardless of the bound state,NONE

1121156678,question,functional component props issues,apologies if this is not the right place for this as im unclear if this is a volar issue or vue core issue update did some more digging and i think i see whats happening sort of it seems that previously when defining functional components we could define them by adding an extra props property on the exported function and typechecking would work correctly for example vue const functionalcomponent props context return hdiv class functionalthing prop1 type string as proptype required true export default functionalcomponent it seems recently something changed and now the types are being inferred from the types set on the props arg only similar to how things work when using typebased props syntax on defineprops vue type shapeofmyprops prop1 foo bar const functionalcomponent props shapeofmyprops context return hdiv class functionalthing export default functionalcomponent while at first glance this seems great there are a few issues some features are only available via the object based syntax default values validation functions boolean coercion which means well still have to use the object syntax in addition in many cases the shape of the props when passed to the function are different than the shape that define the props for example an optional boolean prop or a prop with a default value is optional when using the component but will always be defined when passed into the function regardless well need to figure out best practices here add some examples in the vue docs and make sure everything works with what is recommended having two ways to do things in normal components non functional still presents some problems as well so i think there may be a larger discussion to be had in general personally i think requiring the object syntax to define the props would make sense and volar can infer the prop types relevant to using the component from that object the shape of the props arg within the function should then be able to be inferred fairly easily i think extractproptypes already does this i dont know if theres any way to make this happen automatically though so it will have to be explicit for example typescript const propsdefinition prop1 type string as proptype required true const functionaltest3 props extractproptypes context any return hdiv class functionaltest3 contextslotsdefault functionaltest3props propsdefinition some examples of whats not working image repro with some examples available here thanks,NONE

1264616804,question,issue with sticky sessions,hi all basically we are running java application using tomcat docker image which is deployed on kubernetes everything works fine when there is only 1 replica when we try to run 2 replicas for instance at first there was a problem where user was not able to log in the application this was kind of fixed by using kubernetes nginxingress sticky sessions using cookie as affinity it basically forced user to access the same tomcat pod all the time and user was able to log in but this is not ideal as whenever new pod is deployed user needs to log in again thats when we started to look around for some session management and came upon redisson for tomcat and it sounded exactly what we needed so i decided to try it out so first i added this to contextxml file manager readmoderedis updatemodedefault keyprefix and redissonconf looks like this redis single master node deployed on kubernetes as well singleserverconfig 10000 connecttimeout 10000 timeout 3000 retryattempts 3 retryinterval 1500 password null 5 clientname null address redisredismaster6379 1 50 24 connectionpoolsize 64 database 0 5000 threads 16 nettythreads 32 codec transportmode nio added also both redissonall3173jar and files to lib folder tomcat version is 9020 when first accessing my application in catalina log file i saw message info httpnio8080exec10 session cant be found and i was never able to log in my app even using single pod although from rediscli i saw that keys like are being stored then i changed readmodememory in redissonconf file and i was able to log in my app as for my surprise even after deleting pods andor scaling to 2 or 3 pods i was still logged in my app after refreshing the browser awesome exactly what i wanted the issue right now is that whenever there are 2 or more pods for example pod1 and pod2 and i try to log in my app from the pod logs i can see that when first accessing the login screen it goes through pod1 and when trying to log in request goes through pod2 thus never logging user in then again when logging in on pod2 request goes through pod1 after several tries once the request goes through the same pod i am able to log in and use the application even if pods are being recreateddeleted afterwards i am still logged in so the question is it somehow possible for the user on the first log in stay at the same tomcat pod even after login request is sent similarly as with nginxingress sticky sessions when requests are sent to the same pod thanks in advance,NONE

833307386,question,question export method copies files to sourcefolder,i have a patch file that i want to apply to some source files that i pull down from a git repo i dont control the source in the repo so for now i have to apply my patch myself i dont want to package the patched source with my recipe due to space concerns especially since the patch is a minor change in the conanfilepy in the source method i clone the repo and then apply the patch using toolspatch after messing around a bit how to get the path to the patch file i ended up getting it to work by referencing the recipefolder patchpath fixespatch i then ran into the problem of needing to package the patch file when the recipe is exported to the cacheuploaded reading the document i thought the exports method would be the solution and indeed it does cause the patch file to be in the export folder in the cache next to the conanfilepy however it looks like export is also copying the patch file to the source folder when i run conan create even though the documentation seems to say that shouldnt happen when i use conan source sf testsrc to test retrieving the sources from the repo the export method is called so this looks like the intended behavior this causes my clone to fail as git complains that the folder is not empty i believe i could clone the source into a subfolder to address the not empty folder but figured i would ask if this is the expected behavior for the export method and if there is another option other than than doing the subfolder im a little hesitant to clone into a subfolder and that seems like it could open up the need to ensure im running the cmake configure build and install steps on the subfolder instead of on the toplevel sourcefolder im using version 1341 and saw the same behavior in 1330 x ive read the contributing guide,NONE

1098807212,question,refactor ssmsvinit,a question for jhui the initial codegeneration scheme that i pilfered from the fdlpaper took a program like this f int x var 5 and turned that into c a struct an enterfunction a stepfunction with the initialization of x happening inside the stepfunction c void step switch pc case 0 initializeint32x assignint32x 5 etc a problem with this is that if the initialization only happens in a conditional branch it might be skipped altogether and then the reference might skip initialization making any usage of it illegal the only use we might have made of it however was to dequeue any outstanding event on it before we exit the stepfunction the solution was naturally to lift the initializeint32 call to the enterfunction and leave the assignment of the initial value in the stepfunction with the new scheme in the dev branch i am not sure that this is possible or i am just missing it ssmsvinit takes as a parameter not just the reference in question but also the initial value of the reference this value depends on when in time the reference is initialized and can not be lifted to the enterfunction without changing the semantics if ssmsvinit was split up into something like ssmsvinitssmsvt sv and sv ssmvaluet initval with ssmsvinitassign essentially behaving like ssmassign with the exception that it doesnt mark the value as having been updated at this point in time we can do the same refactoring of course if we never need to chase a reference if we dont initialize it this isnt an issue but we seem to be dropping all of them before exiting the stepfunction,NONE

997635803,question,better changelog for removal of deprecated features,gday team i am concerned with the lack of breaking change notices in the change log when clientcore prs 3118 and 3135 removed the category from pivot this caused a breaking change that was undocumented in the change log and also wouldnt comply with the new version tag when upgrading from 0280 to 0281 we reviewed the changelog and deemed nothing of importance to worry about net result is this caused breaking production issues for our platform a patch version should never result in this after careful review we have identified that theres a lack of standards in regards to the deprecation and removal of features and also the use of semver for the project as a whole some examples of this would be adding or removing features which are then released as a patch instead of a minor version breaking production changes released without a major number change anyways i think its important to standardise this and stop the community being bitten by such actions thanks karl,NONE

1097219885,question,noise accumulation by layer size,hello im trying to check how the layer size of the network effects the noisiness of the output technical details of the test architecture resnet34 structure for training on cifar from here dataset randomly generated values from gaussian distribution os linux ubuntu 2004 gpu nvidia geforce rtx 3070 kit version 040 in the test which can be viewed here ive used the following steps 1 separated the resnet34 model into the most basic layers conv2d relu batchnorm2d etc 2 converted each layer to analog and activated the noise as described here 3 fed the data into each conv2dlinear layer to the ideal one and to the analog one and stored the outputs ill refer to the ideal output as the x vector and the analog output as the y vector 4 plotted the mean std of the yx vector the results are confusing by looking at the graph attached below it looks like theres no relation between the layer size and the accumulated noise it doesnt make any sense because as you previously mentioned in other issues the size of the layer determines the number of functioning devices on the crossbar and i expect that as more devices are activated the more noise i will see note the layer with 512 xlabel is a linear layer all the rest are convolutional layers i would appreciate it if you could confirm that those are indeed strange results and perhaps explain in some more details where exactly in the code do you add the noise at each crosspoint perhaps you have any idea what could cause the strange pattern in the difference vector ryx thank you very much for you time and attention,NONE

1159355541,question,tracking packages width height length using capacityamount,hello it seems that the capacityamount multidimensional quantities are summed component wise and therefore are best suited to tracking weight and volume especially of liquids or number of items which can be summed due to the above checking whether a vehicle can hold another package defined by its three dimensions width height and length seems not possible at least at the moment is this correct for example if my vehicle has a 1m x 1m x 1m trunk and i want to pick up two 1m x 001m x 001m rods i will not be able to because the engine will sum up the quantities to 2m 002m 002m and the first one violates the capacity restriction i had a look at all the issues and one of them suggests using skills for modelling such case but i need to use skills for other purpose is there any way to overcome this,NONE

1155562217,question,cuurently there are huge gaps of information required by python new starters,question i thought assumed that cookietemple could be used to bootstrap a projects boilerplate for both cli applications and libraries in practice this is not the case unless i am mistaken which i most probably am but cant trace down this information because its not in the docs to create a python library cookietemple create widgetlib choose the projects domain lib choose the projects primary language use arrow keys » cpp warning notice here that the only language option here is cpp if i progress to the end of the process it creates the project but in a huge heap of errors since this is a cpp project i will say no more about this because i am only interested in python lib and cli so on the face of it it appears i can not create a python lib with cookietemple so how can i get the benefits of a cookietemple preconstructed project boilerplate for a python lib now onto a python cli cookietemple create widgetcli choose the projects primary language use arrow keys » python java cookie hoorah we can select python so again complete this process and this time the project is created without errors from chatting in discord i have been made aware that building for a cli and library is the same thing just use domaincli please document this somewhere having a lib option that doesnt work for python is confusing and misleading without having extra info that does not appear to be present anywhere looking into the generated project the first thing i tried to do was build the project taking a look at the makefile there is no target called build the nearest item is a cleanbuild target which essentially does very little in the context of needing to build the project it wasnt until i scrolled down to the bottom of the make file that i noticed a non intuitive task name called dist which is the task i was looking for why is this task called distand not build as one would expect especially since there is a cleanbuild target the other big area of confusion is to do with poetry and conda for managing dependencies in the project and the environment please can we have this documented somewhere as this is totally confusing for new python devs the problem is both conda poetry can manage environments but to a new user it is not clear the distinction between the 2 its not just a simple matter of reading the documentation of these 2 project because they appear to do the same thing and the differences are very subtle it would be nice if guidelines on when to use poetry and conda were documented as as it stands i dont know for example what the difference is between poetry shell and conda activate for activating an environment and to install dependencies do we install them into the environment with conda or do we do it with poetry and how do we distinguish between project dependencies and environment dependencies i guess this is something ill find out in the dev cycle but i would prefer to learn about this type of thing up front to avoid and minimise a miserable experience later on i have also noticed quite other in the documentation like the use of tox vs nox please dont get me wrong this is a great project and i really commend you for the work you have done its just the few rough edges is making this more difficult to use that it should be for those starting out on their python journies like me,NONE

1117450986,question,error not compiled with gpu support on windows nvcc installed,hi i am having trouble installing pytorch3d library on windows i know it can be tricky but i have only this solution at the moment i am sorry in advance if this is a duplicate question or something trivial but i spent quite some time looking at the other issues and i didnt find a solution i followed the installmd guide created a new conda environment installed all the necessary libraries and then installed from source with pip install git it isnt specified if this works for windows too but i tried and it seems its fine anyway i encountered some troubles in importing the c library but i tried installing visual studio tools and i managed to make it work anyway i tried many things so i cant exactly tell you which steps i took sorry i was finally ready to launch some demo tutorials but when running the exercise i find the error in the title namely runtimeerror not compiled with gpu support when calling the underlying c functions i saw that it might be a cuda compiler error so i downloaded all the tools like nvcc now its recognized correctly by the terminal but it is not working i also tried setting some environment variables like cudahome pointing at the nvcc directory but either it is not working or im doing something wrong i didnt apply any patch to the headers yet it was hard to find the instructions but it seems that those changes are answering another range of problems that i didnt encounter yet it would be very appreciated if you could suggest me something in order to try and solve this matter thank you in advance for your kindness and your consideration here you can find some details on my environment let me know if i can provide additional information os windows 11 nvidia rtx

1185216307,question,managing which create token endpoint to use with different versions of artifactory,describe the bug this is a weirdish one weve been working on a migration from v6 → v7 for goingon 10 months now im going to skip the why and simply say that weve filed a few dozen tickets with support as part of the upgrade we started on v7243 then went to v7297 and now were on v73110 during the time we were on v7243 the nowdeprecated create token endpoint was the only one that worked as advertised because the old endpoint was deprecated before the new endpoint had parity support instructed us to use the old endpoint then we went to v7297 and remote repositories stopped caching even when the user had the deploycache permission between the opening of the ticket and the resolution of the ticket we moved to v73110 at that point support explained that the docs say the old endpoint is deprecated so stupid me i guess anyway caching only started working again when i replaced the token created by the old endpoint with a token created by the new endpoint it seems that the incomplete state of the new endpoint in v7243 was resolved at some point and the old endpoint was no longer function for practical purposes it still vends a token but the token inexplicably doesnt work for certain cases while still working for others question how does this provider handle the apparently very fluid approach to creating access tokens using different endpoints across different versions of v7 or does it is the provider tested across multiple versions of artifactory server or just latestish requirements for and issue x a fully functioning terraform snippet that can be copypasted no outside files or env vars unless thats part of the issue this worked on v7243 i just got a response from support about v73110 and havent had a chance to test it again yet hcl resource artifactorygroup svcaccountgroup name varaccountname create the artifactory user password must be defined then we can disable it resource artifactoryuser svcaccountuser name varaccountname email varaccountemail groups readers varaccountname password dependson true create a timer for rotating the access token the triggers setting forces a token rotation before expiration resource timerotating nowplusdays rotationdays 2 lambda should rotate daily with some jitter triggers key timestamp create a random password for user resource randompassword password length 64 create accesstoken for the user use either enddate or enddaterelative exclusively resource svcaccountuser username enddate refreshable true groups x your version of artifactory you can curl it at presently v73110 x your version of terraform 11x expected behavior this provider is tested across multiple versions of artifactory v7 and there are smoke tests that show that things inside of artifactory still work as expected when generating an access token on an older v7 installation with the older endpoint and a newer v7 installation with the newer endpoint the provider handles each case appropriately depending on the users version of artifactory,NONE

549331815,question,generic syntax limitations,please correct me if i am wrong but looking at the generic syntax right now and as far as i can tell there appear to be some limitations lets say i have a generic struct foo and i want to have a free function that only operates on foos is there a syntax to do this i could only make a fully generic function but none that only worked on foos ie v struct foo bar t this works but compiles for any type not just foo fn printfoof t printlnf this does not compile fn printfoo2f foo printlnf what if i want a signature that only accepts a specific foo type also does not work afaik fn printfoo3f foo printlnf fn main f foo bar 25 printfoof printfoo2f printfoo3f another thing that would be amazing is if you could specify methods that only work on certain instantiations of foo ie v fn f foo foof32method of course with the existing generic method syntax that wont really work as there is no way to disambiguate it from v fn f foo foof32method maybe using a prefix such as or for the generic template parameters could be a way to allow that in the future ie v fn f foo foogenericmethod i am just blurting this out after toying around with the current system please correct me if i missed something and share your thoughts thanks,NONE

1108698828,question,issue with license file checkout when using singularity exec but not with singularity shell,version of singularity 385 type of issue we are running abaqus 2019 in a singularity container on an hpc using the pbs batch script with the pbs job scheduler when running the job there is no issue with abaqus checking out its license from the remote license server possibly because we specify the path to the license server inside an abaqusv6env file located in the working directory but there are two other software we use in conjunction with abaqus one is the intel fortran compiler compfl the other is a third party abaqus plugin and they are not acting as expected when checking out their licenses the license checkout behaviour changes depending on whether we use singularity exec via a pbs batch script or singularity shell the license manager is flexlm in all cases the locations of the license files are set in the pbs batch script using the following lines prior to invoking singularity set environment variable for intel fortran compiler license file export number redactedserver name redacted set environment variable for the third party plugin license file export number redactedserver name redacted when running the job via pbs job scheduler and batch script containing singularity exec we get errors about not being able to checkout the licenses for compfl intel compiler and the third party plugin this is despite the fact that we do see the correctly set environment variables when we run printenv via singularity exec so we do know that these environment variables are being set and passed into the container properly when running the job without pbs scheduler by setting the environment variables and simply running singularity shell on the login node of the hpc and then running abaqus directly from the singularity shell we have no issue checking out the license for the third party plugin ie i get the desired result which is different than with singularity exec despite this i still cannot get the fortran license to checkout even from within a singularity shell this might be a separate issue to do with the intel compiler suite running lmstat a c portnumberserver name redacted on the host hpc as well as within the singularity container shell on the host hpc both return a good result that clearly shows all the licenses being available ie this is not a network issue affecting the connection to the license server however running lmstat a c portnumberserver name redacted via singularity exec via a pbs batch script returns intel cannot connect to license server system 15570115 operation now in progress tldr license checkout result is not the same when using singularity exec via a pbs batch script run through the pbs job scheduler vs

1259877657,question,deciding type equality for two flat types aka contracts aka opaque types,contracts and more generally even if that may be meaningless at runtime any valid term can appear inside a type annotation the semantics as far as the typechecker is concerned is that those terms are seen as blackbox opaque types which can only unify with themselves for example nickel let foocontract in x foocontract let bar 5 foocontract in bar this typechecks because the contract application 5 foocontract ensures to either fail with a contract error or that 5 satisfies foocontract thus indeed bar foocontract however the current check is very fragile and even unsound unifying two flat types requires them to be variables or fails otherwise see 701 this is far too limiting for many usecases if they are variables it just compares their names but names may be shadowed so this is unsound for example the following passes let foocontract str in let foo foocontract let foocontract num in 5 foocontract in foo this typechecks but fails at runtime with a contract error ouch this situation leads to the following question how should we decide type equality between two contracts flat types for variables we must have a way to check that they refer to the same definition we may also want to support more complex expressions like contract application nullable str should be unifiable with nullable str on the other hand we probably dont want to do general substitution and allow let barcontract foocontract to be equal to foocontract because this is a slippery slope that could lead to arbitrary computations being run during typechecking,MEMBER

971728685,question,codebase impovement proposals,right now we have many small issues within our codebase which makes the code less maintainable and robust this issue contains a quick overview of problems and proposals related to some topics with a short description feel free to participate in discussions and make your proposals in the end we should create small issues based on this one topics 1 redux as a single source of truthp1 2 atomic state changesp2 3 add data types everywherep3 4 tweak eslint rulesp4 5 repo structurep5 6 sync app settings with redux statep6 7 testsp7 in the discussion please refer to the problemproposal number 1 redux as a single source of truth we have a mix of redux state with component states that relates to the whole app it causes some problems that can not be fixed easily or at least the logic is not straightforward for example we use reactrouter which contains the route in its component state and passes history and location in context so it works in parallel with redux and it can not be handled from redux actionsmiddlewares as a result we have to add some return value to actions check them and then decide which screen to show within components also it makes error handling a bit complicated proposal №1 use component state only for things that are related only to this component and which are not actual after component unmounted for example it is good to store an input value until it will commit to the redux state or sent it to some handler which in the end will update the redux state for other cases use redux state this proposal includes replacing reactrouter with reactreduxrouter or something similar so we can trigger changing of the screen by changing the state right within redux proposal №2 actions should be simple and dont know anything about consumers so they should not return anything except simple redux action object which should be dispatched in case that some thunk action depends on the result of another thunkaction it should get action which can be dispatched and take needed data from the payload for example user creates new transaction and dispatches a thunk action which calls sendtransaction args type sendtransaction payload txid transactionid and then it dispatches returned action takes a transaction id from the payload and dispatches switching screen reactreduxrouter to proposal №3 since this topic needs a huge refactoring we can also switch to some handy libraries from reduxtoolkit like reduxslice to make less boilerplate and make the related code more maintainable 2 atomic state changes most of the complicated actions dispatch a bunch of small actions that update redux state one by one redux has an internal mechanism that reduces the amount of rerenderings for such cases so probably this is not a problem however if something will go wrong on one of the dispatched actions well get an inconsistent state something already updated something not proposal to keep the app state consistent we should make state changes atomic it means that if some action will change a bunch of things in the state it should be done within one change so if something went wrong the state wont change at all and it will be kept in a previous consistent state redux community already has solutions for such cases which simplifies writing small actions and batching it reduxbatchedactions but im not sure that this solution will fit all our needs you can add a middleware to dispatch each of the bundled actions this can be used if other middlewares are listening for one of the bundled actions to be dispatched more research is needed 3 add data types everywhere in the code we can often meet any type or tsignore it makes code more complicated and turns off static typing as a result it lowers the power of typescript such things also hide errors that are easily caught by static typing proposal №1 get rid of all any types and tsignore as a result we can turn on strict mode on ts and on eslint it will make code more robust and maintainable also it includes passing types through ipc and other pubsub buses and one more thing which i highlighted in a separate proposal proposal №2 checkmarkbutton done generate typescript types from proto files and refactor services a bit ive already taken a look at few libraries which can help up with that and i think that just updating grpcprotoloader to the latest one and use bundled protoloadergentypes will work for us and require the smallest amount of changes to the code base 4 tweak eslint rules probably this is the most minor thing except ban tsignore described above but it may make code more readable and also provide better git diffs proposal mark most things as errors to avoid collecting linting warnings and change rules disallow tsignore limit line length to 80120 chars allow noparens for small arrow functions eg thena apayload turn on commadangle clean diffs on property set change i believe that this is not a full list of changes 5 repo structure we have a little mess in the directory structure desktop — main process files desktopdist — built renderer files app — renerer process sources resources — assets for electronbuilder shared — sources of things shared between the renderer and main processes dll — built js files for dev release — bundled electron app so all these things look complicated since we also have scripts configs proto directories moreover we have a bunch of webpack configs which point to different paths and complicated gitignore file proposal move all sources and assets in the src directory srcmain srcrenderer srcassets srcshared put all artifacts in the dist folder dekstopdist distbuild dll distdev release distrelease update configs and get rid of excessive ones gitignore 6 app settings right now we store in the app settings only few things such as netsettings record localnode flag accounts map it should contain more things eg resizing the app window or switching theme does not save between app sessions proposal create a separate redux reducer which will be synced with these settings on the startup it can request settings from the main process and update the state on any further updating of this state it can be caught by middleware it can request updating such data in the electrons persistent store 7 tests now it has no tests at all in general this can be understood because basically our application is a facade for interacting with the node so most of the things are depend on node and to make most of the tests we have to mock a node however moking a node is fragile and difficult to maintain and it is possible that such tests will not benefit however it is quite scary to make any big refactoring until we have no tests so each big change may produce a lot of bugs which can not be caught manually in a reasonable time especially since some cases need a synced node and other things i have few ideas about unit testing small things and creating crosslanguage mocks for grpc as a testing tool but it needs more research if you have ideas — feel free to share,MEMBER

1198116111,question,how to include extended features eg state variables like temperature or pressure in a restricted search space fixed parameter with out of design value,the model requires certain features in order to obtain a good fit but these parameters are not fixed nor are they necessarily something that makes sense to be optimized for especially in the existing data 743 an example would be vickers hardness measurements scraped from scientific literature the vickers hardness depends on the applied load of the vickers tip which varies from publication to publication in this case from experience removing the applied load results in almost no predictive performance however if provided to the algorithm as a search parameter it will naturally suggest minimizing the applied load because vickers hardness is almost always higher for smaller loads this same thing appears in many materials science chemistry optimization problems including several of the projects im working on phrased another way the model benefits from additional features appended not replacing but only optimizes over the original features the fixedparameter class comes to mind but i dont think the intention was for a fixedparameter to vary for every datapoint the discussion in related to sequential search spaces also comes to mind but after attempting to use this i get bash fixed parameter size with out of design value 50 passed to removefixed file line 51 in raise valueerror file line 217 in transformdata obsfeats file line 170 in init obsfeats obsdata searchspace selftransformdata file line 99 in init superinit file line 342 in call modelbridge bridgeclass file line 61 in model bayesmodel file line 183 in ypreds ystds nextexperiments trialindices model file line 87 in runcode execcode runglobals file line 97 in runmodulecode runcodecode modglobals initglobals file line 268 in runpath return runmodulecodecode initglobals runname file line 87 in runcode execcode runglobals file line 197 in runmoduleasmain current frame return runcodecode mainglobals none call stack bash transformdata init init call runcode runmodulecode runpath runcode runmoduleasmain current frame so i guess the idea of using fixedparameter doesnt pan out because of the use of removefixed maybe a way to get around this is to set narrow bounds in a new search space for a rangeparameter or set a choiceparameter with only one choice not sure if the latter would throw an error,CONTRIBUTOR

1324964140,question,data movement v2,over the course of implementing data movement there were several observations and lessons learned along the way 1 large complexity supporting the two implementations lustre and rsync this leads to a large development burden particularly as new features like 23 and 24 are developed 2 there is a large complexity and startup cost using the mpi operator from kubeflow each node must be assigned a label the mpi workers pods must start k8s must assign dns names to each pod and finally the launcher pod starts ive seen this take 30 seconds on occasion 1015s on average which could be greater than the file transfer time in some cases 3 llnl has raised concerns about using rsync as it is single threaded particularly for large directory trees as used in nnf08 parallel execution wrapper around rsync is possible but that doesnt address issues 1 or 2 v2 goals to address these issues with the v1 implementation i am proposing v2 aimed at these goals 1 unifies the code under one implementation using mpifileutils 2 allows for parallel execution on a single node using mpi slots 3 avoids the startup cost of mpi operator these goals are achieved with the following implementation highlights 1 one mpi worker pod per rabbit that never exits something very similar is already done for the rsync implementation 2 each data movement resource executes the mpirun with the hosts argument targeting the desired rabbitsmpi workers this leverages the mpi operator code if 2 or more slots are required then a hostfile can be used concerns there is one concerns for this implementation that i can come up with beyond the development effort 1 mpi overhead are there valid use cases ie fewsmall files where starting an mpirun operation is more overhead then rsync implementation details data movement resource the data movement custom resource remains unchanged in format the data movement controller is rewritten to execute the mpirun command this command requires 1 a hosts argument used to target the specific rabbit nodes the data movement controller will translate a rabbit node name to the corresponding mpi worker pod 2 that proper ssh keys are loaded to communicate with the work pods this requires the data movement controller to be launched with the correct secrets in the deployment specification mpi worker pods one mpi worker pod will run for each rabbit using a kubernetes daemonset with the necessary nodeselector toleration as done elsewhere in nnfsos and nnfdm for the rsync implementation the daemonset would contain the global lustre mounts ephemeral lustre would require the lustre mount is present in the mnt directory worker pods are started running sshd in a detached state usrsbinsshd de ssh keys mpi uses ssh to start remote programs from the launcher we therefore need to share keys amongst the workers and launcher pods mpi operator accomplishes this by generating ssh keys and creating kubernetes secrets with both private and public key when creating the worker and launcher pods the secrets are mounted into the idrsa idrsapub and authorizedkeys files the v2 implementation closely parallels this with the daemonset describing the worker pods containing the same cmd and volume mounts as used by mpi operator initializing data movement deployment and worker pods as covered earlier a kubernetes secret representing the rsa security keys must be shared between launcher and worker pods this requires a bootstrapping of the pods having created the secrets earlier the picture below highlights both the bootstrapping process red and an example data movement operation blue nnfdmv2 1,CONTRIBUTOR

941331986,question,optimizing resource lifetime tracking,this is copypasted from what i wrote on the wgpu matrix im putting it here so it doesnt get lost the context is wanting to reduce lifetime tracking overhead as much as possible compared to wgpuhal preferably as close to zero as possible if the tracking requirements are not complex its kind of awkward actually it seems like there are two good options at two ends of the tradeoff space in terms of reducing overhead for tracking 1 refcount immediately on submission to the command buffer like metal does obviously safe very easy to use but you lose sophisticated optimization opportunities due to having to worry about state thats tracked in command buffers that havent been submitted yet more generally what you really would want here is some sort of optimized tracing garbage collection since the vast majority of the time resources used by a queue would still be alive the next frame anyway but optimized tracing gc in rust particularly safe stable rust is still a long way away i think though i do think well get there eventually and whether it will ever be ergonomic is an open question 2 dont refcount stuff in command buffers at all still use refcounting for resources used by other resources since for these refcounting has basically perfect tradeoffs for this scenario instead wait until you know the order commands will be submitted in on a queue using borrows to guarantee that the objects are alive until this point and then use priority update to update each object in the queue exactly once to its latest submission version this is basically the most efficient option possible if you cant peek into the actual raw command buffer data it allows speedy resource reclamation since it completely avoids hashmap overhead which is substantial with large numbers of objects and has minimal write overhead only one shared write per submission to a queue even if an object is used thousands of times cachefriendlier than arc without hashmap when an object is dropped it can just check its version against the current queue version dropping the underlying resource only if its version is not on the queue anymore with a variety of options for what to do when the object is still on the queue so 2 is basically what i want to use but it conflicts significantly with the webgpu spec in the following sense if i know the relative order command buffers will be submitted in ahead of time like i think how youre intended to use metal i can set the versions right away while live recording and avoid needing very long borrows but webgpu says the submission order of command buffers is not fixed ahead of time if i dont i can still satisfy these requirements with some more local but cheap overhead by delaying setting versions of the objects i record until i submit to the queue but then i need to keep a borrow open not just as long as a renderpass but for the duration of the whole queue submission for veloren this would not be an issue but i think a lot of stuff already struggles to hold stuff resources open for just the duration of the renderpass being recorded there are other possibilities besides what i suggested for trying to reduce overhead in common cases but so far i havent been able to figure out anything that isnt just a benchmark hack or has other bad tradeoffs eg if you acquire a version speculatively when you create a command buffer and then hold onto it randomly for the rest of your program we probably dont want that to infinitely delay collection of any resources for command buffers created afterwards additionally what i just said is i think the most efficient safe way to do resource lifetime tracking short of asking submitted objects to stay alive across multiple frames and manually specifying a blocking cleanup scope which some people claim is a common gamedev pattern but i dont believe them or some related rooting scheme that seems likely even more complicated to use but for buffers and textures as featured in bunnymark we also lose overhead to stateconflict tracking and i still am not sure what the best way to deal with that is and i think probably the best solutions to reduce overhead will conflict with the webgpu spec even more significantly than needing to know command buffer order ahead of time if we already need to use hashmaps anyway on a large percentage of the resources we track then i suspect that will probably dominate the overhead of lifetime tracking in most cases so what im thinking is it would be nice if wgpu somehow made its rust api able to support both modes of use refcounting a la metal or version tracking and delaying it until queue submission but i dont know what the best way to do that would be imo you can probably do more and fancier optimizations if you can just specify the version up front while also being more ergonomic than holding resources borrowed for the length of a whole queue submission but this more outwardly conflicts with the wgpu api while just having more restricted lifetime constraints technically doesnt currently with what im working on eliminating hubs mode 1 is going to be the easiest approach to implement but i want to make sure we keep mode 2 open hence i dont want to remove the lifetime constraints just yet with my changes,CONTRIBUTOR

1150489228,question,neither farm startdate nor cage startdate coincide with the beginning of the simulation,the main problem is that while cages have a relatively welldefined start date with respect to a production cycle farms may not obviously if all cages would be stocked and fallowed at the same time the farm starting date would coincide with the cages and it is likely to happen in practice why is it important almost all calculations rely on cage start date eg salmon growth but the start date of the farm is only used to reset the treatment counter as a result it may happen that farmers may apply more treatments than allowed to and make logging confusing for example in the fyne configuration both farms believe the simulation begins in october 2017 the farms open between october and november of that year but the simulation actually begins in january 2018 because of that sea lice counts are virtually 0 for the first two months of the production cycle despite cages are open honestly i dont really know how to feel about this i would be happy with removing a farm start date or making it coincide with the earliest cage opening date but maybe it would be better and simpler to make all cages start by default when the simulation begins magicicada anthonyohare,COLLABORATOR

1143445621,question,tadgan runtime,dear sarah i see you closed this issue and released a new master question if you remember my problem which was this issue was that i wanted to train tadgan model on many different files where each file has about 18000 rows of time stamps and values in the 2nd column before every time it when to a new file to train epochs after about 100 files it would take more than 12 hour for it to get to the next file when at the beginning it would just take 6 minutes between the 1st and 2nd file using a cpu and it would exponentially increasing time with each file i assume you fixed the problem above you say one can either use orionfitdata or orionfitdata buildtrue i am confused as to which one to use if i want my model to train on thousands of files but not have the training take more time between each file do i use the buildtrue but if i am fitting another model what does that mean if i pick that and train on thousands of different files will the be thousands of different models i assume i pick that so it want continue taking more time increasing between each file and also now that its a master if i update the orionml i assume it will have that fix right thanks nicholas originally posted by nickyvnyc in,COLLABORATOR

1268464920,question,why wouldnt returned dicts with outtypelist not have an n field,astutely brought up by reviewer muawizchaudhary during cr of 862 in 1d the scattering method ends on a rather strange note python elif outtype list for x in outs xpopn return outs in other words were going out of our way to conceal the n field to the outtypelist user personally i dont see a justification for not exposing n it is quite easy to understand and reuse it can be seen as a pointer or tuple of pointers to the filterbank psi1f or tuple of filterbanks psi1f psi2f and n is already exposed to the user anyway under the form of skeys with outtypedict 861 so i dont think were running into a big risk of introducing a new functionality that will be difficult to maintain in the future hence i propose to experiment with removing this xpopn statement and if the tests pass make it part of v03 theres nothing in it that couldnt be achieved with outdictdict and functional programming some advanced looping mechanisms like for kv in sitems but not all our users are familiar with those pythonic idioms so giving them access to n as the value of a simple data type dict contained in a list is a good way to let them write custom code that inspects psi metadata n relation with s activations this change would remove code in 1d and add very little code in 2d3d thoughts,COLLABORATOR

931932412,question,figure out how broadly we define maniplexes,the definition of maniplex that i mostly use is something like a simple nvalent properly nedgecolored graph such that nonadjacent colors commute under this definition the smallest possible 2maniplex has 4 flags in terms of the connection group this says that the generating connections do not have any fixed points and that no product of two distinct generators has any fixed point on the other hand the broadest possible definition allows both multiple edges and semiedges for example we could just have a single flag and have every ri act trivially with a semiedge we certainly want to be able to deal with the broad definition in some contexts such as symmetry type graphs and when dealing with maps so this is primarily a question of naming the two approaches that come to mind are 1 we use maniplex to mean that the underlying graph is simple and another term for the broader class in his thesis elias uses multimaniplex for the broader definition 2 we use maniplex for the broad definition and then something like simple maniplex for when the underlying graph is simple whichever way we go i anticipate making a gap category for the broad definition probably some of the code we have so far for maniplexes is implicitly assuming a simple underlying graph,COLLABORATOR

1044062561,question,corrupted data part doesnt get restored automatically from replica,hi all my team and i have been working on setting up the clickhouse cluster and pocing it as the solution to our analytical data store as part of this effort in preparation for rolling out the cluster we were conducting different experiments in order to know more about the behavior as well as be ready for any unexpected outcomes one of such experiments was to corrupt some data parts and observe whether those parts would be recovered automatically from the second replica by the way just to give you some context on how our cluster looks like it contains 3 shards 2 replicas each where most of the tables use the engine however it appears that data corruption in clickhouse is discoveredrepaired from replicas only when data is accessed eg via a query this is also mentioned in the official clickhouse docs found here when the server starts or establishes a new session with zookeeper it only checks the quantity and sizes of all files if the file sizes match but bytes have been changed somewhere in the middle this is not detected immediately but only when attempting to read the data for a select query the query throws an exception about a nonmatching checksum or size of a compressed block in this case data parts are added to the verification queue and copied from the replicas if necessary this has been also verified by us we executed the query to pull some data from that specific broken data part and initially it returned the exception code 33 dbexception received from com9000 dbexception cannot read all data bytes read 22694 bytes expected 29294 while reading column while reading from part from mark 72 with maxrowstoread 8192 while executing mergetreethread however the second attempt was successful and the returned dataset was exactly the same as the one returned by replica 2 it was also confirmed that the broken data part appeared in the detached folder and it was restored in the filesystem the point is that we assumed that the recovery would be kicked off automatically in the background rather than after some action triggered by the client this leads us to start being anxious about the possible complete data loss when the repair process is not identified automatically for example the following set of circumstances could lead to complete data loss 1 data gets corrupted on replica1 at time t0 2 same data part on replica 2 gets corrupted sometime later say t0 10 days 2 corrupted data on replica1 is only accessed and attempted to get restored from replica2 at time t0 20 days obviously if the corrupted data was identifiedfixed quickly then there is a low risk of replica2 getting corrupted before replica1 has a chance to repair its data however in reality the data may not be recognized as corrupted for a long time eg 20 days as in the example above then it means that during that whole time that were running on a single accurate replica theres a risk of us completely losing the data as such we wanted to know whether clickhouse provides any other mechanismoption for recognizing corrupted data more quickly if there is no such does anyone have any experience tackling this problem any suggestionsinsights will be much appreciated thank you in advance,NONE

1105672823,question,how do i programmatically add a dock widget to a dock container widget,hope you dont mind me posing this as a question im using ads in a fullscreen multimonitor app and to allow dock widgets to be docked into each monitor ive set it up so that a cdockcontainerwidget is created for each monitor passing the dock manager into its constructor1 this works great for letting the user dock widgets into each monitor but im struggling to work out how to programmatically add dock widgets to these containers in order to add a default widget for each monitor what ive tried thus far in case it helps seems to be the obvious api to do this and it indeed works except that the dock managers map of docked widgets isnt updated to include the new one causing eg deserialisation to break the only place that seems to update this map and emit a dockwidgetadded signal is and its related methods within the same class however this defaults to using the dock manager as the container which can only be overridden by passing it a cdockareawidget that already exists inside the intended container – and as no dock widgets have been added to the container yet the container doesnt contain any dock area widgets yet and so i dont have one available to pass in additionally this method just forwards on to which makes me unsure if the method on cdockcontainerwidget is intended to be used publicly… i tried working around this by calling followed by with the same dock widget which will add it to the map and add it to the dock container deleting the floating dock container in the process however this apparently causes memoryrelated bugs within the library namely a pointer within becomes dangling potentially crashing the application inside while this feels like a bug within the library to me this kind of workaround is bound to be fragile so id rather not have to do something like this if its possible honestly this is the approach i had implemented until i became aware of the memory bug in hindsight i probably shouldve instead posed this question sooner but ah well personfacepalming hopefully ive not missed something but is there an intended way to add dock widgets to a dock container such that the dock manager is made aware of the added dock widget or if there isnt currently one is it worth adding a new adddockwidgetstyle method to cdockmanager that allows you to specify the container that the widget should be added to 1 technically as cdockmanager is a subclass of cdockcontainerwidget one of the monitors uses the cdockmanager as its container but i digress…,NONE

means that multiple copies of the openmp runtime have been linked into the program that is dangerous since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results the best thing to do is to ensure that only a single openmp runtime is linked into the process eg by avoiding static linking of the openmp runtime in any library as an unsafe unsupported undocumented workaround you can set the environment

1229956357,question,over or underreporting of structural variants or repeats close to contig borders,dear fenderglass co we are working on a genome assembly of a peculiar species that has intermediate 1 heterozygosity for snps but notable structural polymorphism in particular those that alter genome size which occupy several of the genome we have produced various test assemblies and we note that many of these svs are statistically depleted towards contig borders as are various repeats this is seemingly opposite to our expectations ie svs or repeats should be enriched close to borders if they act to limit contiguity but on the other hand i am not deeply familiar with the flye algorithm in cases where contigs can not be extended due to ambiguity raising from svs or weird repeats heterozygous weird repeats does the algorithm back out leading to in general underreporting rather than overreporting of such causative features close to contig borders i admit that there may be lower power to detect some of these features close to borders anyway but our patterns are so striking we would appreciate a hint about this cheers,NONE

1261163269,question,are the traces correct,sorry for disturbing you with a question as i can see this repo is not yet in a fully released state but this is one of the few codebases around that implements et in pytorch and you also do it in a peculiar way so i wanted to ask you this so i am wondering whether the methodology you are using for accumulating gradients is actually correct as the math seems a bit off the sutton barto book suggests the traces should track the gradient of q while the weights are updated according to delta et it seems to me that your traces track the gradient of the td error instead which corresponds to delta gradq and then the weight updates happen according to delta et although adam is used so id imagine the updates diverge slightly from that now if sgd would be used it seems to me that your implementations updates would effectively be proportional to delta2 gradq in this case wouldnt negative values be completely lost you may get extra exploration capabilities initially doing it your way and the problem of delta2 may actually alleviate as your q value estimator becomes better but it does seem a bit off was this your intention have you explored how your method compares to tracking the gradients of the q value directly i am really interested whether this approach makes sense as in my problem doing it your way seems to help thank you for your time,NONE
