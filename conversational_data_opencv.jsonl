the armnoneeabigcc compiler doesnt support the threads by default and when tried to run armnoneeabigcc v it gave the following output where it says thread model single instead of posix however i want to solve this error because i am trying to compile opencv for a embedded platform as stated before issue submission checklist x i report the issue its not a question x i checked the problem with

using to export the model in powershell text python yolov5exportpy data weights simplify include onnx i tried it with my own exported weights using exportpy and with the default weights and the result is still the same i have also switched between the master v70 and v701 branches and retrying the export i also tried exporting the model in protobuf pb format i even tried building open cv 460 from source all to no avail ive honestly fired all my bullets and couldnt find anything online related to the problem and error i cannot even know where the process is failing and if theres an error from my end heres my mainvoid function where i load the model i believe theres a problem with the opencv code that loads the onnx model below is the code that produces the said problem steps to reproduce c

team works with forumopencvorg stack overflow and other communities to discuss problems tickets with question without real issue statement will be closed x i checked the problem with documentation faq open issues forumopencvorg stack overflow etc and have not found solution places to check opencv documentation faq page opencv forum opencv issue tracker stack overflow branch i updated to latest opencv version and the issue is still there master branch for opencv 4x and 34 branch for opencv 3x releases opencv team supports only latest release for each branch the ticket is closed if the problem is not reproduced with modern version there is reproducer code and related data files videos images onnx etc the best reproducer test case for opencv that we can add to the library recommendations for media files and binary files try to reproduce the issue with images and videos in opencvextra repository to reduce attachment size use png for images if you report some cv related bug but not image reader issue attach the image as archive to the ticket if you report some reader issue image hosting services compress images and it breaks the repro code provide onnx file for some public model or onnx file with with random weights if you report onnx parsing or handling issue architecture details diagram from netron tool can be very useful too see"}, {"role": "assistant",
